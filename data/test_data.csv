lags like a dogs if you dont have a pre good pc and is about as fun as watching dog dry to play out of,0
th game lags even on the lowest settings and this is very troubling for those trying to play. a fix is greatly needed for this.,1
lemme just slip a price from f p no one will notice no one will notice no one.,0
for some reason i cant play on my windows computer. but i was able to on my windows laptop. even though it says it isnt optimized for windows or higher. it doesnt make any sence,0
this is a classic already and masterpiece. one of the best games and especially stealths games you will ever play. easily a out of,1
good for passing time when you are dying of boredom and have no wifi. it is a somewhat intuitive game about hitting marbles.,1
? i would pay to remove this from my list. i hope whoever made this game never works in the game industry again. also please dont support lying game developers by buying this game p,0
"love it, play it every so often, fun and different.",1
"only played it for like, an hour, or so.",1
all you do is run and jump,0
"enter the gungeon is one of the best purchases i have ever made on steam it is adorable, funny, action packed, and it has endless replay value. i absolutely recommend this game to anyone that is interested.",1
"fun game until you are forced to win a race in order to proceed. the game mechanics in the races do not work the same as in all the rest of the game in races your car over under steers, has no traction and spins out all the time - which does not happen out in the world . this is even worse than the t boss battles in deus ex. whoever made the decision to a force a race to continue the game and b change the game mechanics inside the races should be put up against a wall and shot. this is the design equivalent to a game breaking bug. do not buy this game. hours of work just gets completly ed over by this t.",0
"bought is as a joke, still wasn't worth it.",0
"i bought this game way back for full price and i dont regret it! it is a buggy game yes.. but for me is the only survial game that gets my heart going! ive played alot of survialsgames like dayz, h z etc. but no one delivers the same feelings that this game do! bucks? even cheaper on a sale mabey? no reason for you to not try it out. stay the away from screamers or you vill have a horde of nethers on you very fast, and you can not outrun them",1
"i accidentally happened upon the secret room in which i found the attic key.. and since the game ends in the attic i wasn't able to solve any mystery or really play the game at all. the whole thing took me about mins to play through, just by exploring the house and such, i'm very very dissapointed that i payed dollars to accidentally solve the game. i didn't get any story, i have no idea why no one was in the house and have no speculation as to why the sister was missing. waste of my money.",0
the game is fun up until lv in crafting which requires you to buy potions im done with this game until they change this,0
this needs a patch. at the last level with those floating platforms. its impossible to get across them because deadpool insanely stops in mid jump. like there is a wall.,0
"this game is fun.. for minutes. you have or guns around the map and you just endlessly shoot other players. great idea, but needs a lot of refinment. all the servers have like people and if not, they are probbably servers that will be crazy laggy. fun to play, but i think there are better shooter games out there and half of them are free.",0
"pretty good time waster. can be challenging at times, too!",1
"big warning, do not buy. this a shody pc port with locked fps, no graphical option, no compatibility with . sounds. it look worse on pc than on the xbox . the keyboard layout is horrendous an can only be changed by the outside launcher. and it even dont function properly with a xbox controller constant raise of force grabed object",0
"this is a ing scam, this game is all about trash i streamed it and we all fall asleep after hour of gameplay 'gameplay' i should say, you just always need to press your left joystick to the left and you can make yourself some cookies, we were around ppls on the stream we end it in hours this is just a 'hey we make a game which looks like limbo but without the difficult part of it, the atmosphere and the ambience' trash sound out of almost sfx, no music graphism out of gg limbo durability out of hours of gameplay to end it welcome back to price out of kappa almost hours gimme a next time game fully sponsored by youtubers and gaming website. expected t.",0
"very fun rogue-like with a deep, subtly revealed story. in short, i've poured hundreds of hours into this game, gotten all the achievements, and it was rewarding every step of the way.",1
this game is really good.,1
"no good anymore.those truly setting makes this game even worse and worse after crap updates.most important is crap players. if god give me a chance, i will set c on those f ked. now this game goes better,but cheating players your mom dead.",0

"well, i don t know how many games there ve been released where you can create and play a fat, dark green, dog-human. who sounds like some badass demon. or kicking and running into objects with high speed, gliding along a city and make people dance with a dubstep-gun. a really funny and entertaining game, especially if you play with a friend. oh, and it s a bit brutal. out of",1
its rubbish. sloppy control system. major fps drop on indoor levels even though my gfx hardware far exceeds the requirements of the game and not a lot of variety.,0
"this game is great. i just got it, and i love it. there aren't many levels but the ones that are there are.. wow. i love this thing and i wouldn't ever rate it down. out of m o o",1
the smurfs are even worse than csgo.,0
finished the game in hours. seriously saints row? out of,0
"i was waiting in anticipation on this game finally it comes to pc! with some better character models etc! unfortionately i'm very disappointed as this is a port of the mobile version that came out earlier this year.. so for those saying this isn't a port, your wrong! the game might be good even if it's a port from the mobile version, but unfortionately i'm not able to play it at this time. i never liked playing my ff games with mouse and keyboard, so naturally i choose to connect an xbox one controller it's more comfy than a ps controller, and easier to setup . this does not work well, as the character starts running off to the left of the screen and gets stuck there, no matter what way i try to push the stick.. i was really hoping of enjoying this today or tomorrow on my birthday , but looks like i gotta wait some more. was also hoping to get an option to enable widescreen, but doesn't seem like that's gonna happen either. truly disappointed and hoping for a fix for at least the controller soon. if that gets fixed, i'll edit this review to positive.",0
the first game where the mage is totally boring to play!,0
absolutely amazing and refreshing arpg.,1
"a total let down when compared to the original game. the story is bland, the dirty humor nearly gone. of the promised gazillion weapons only a rough combinations are even worth to consider keeping. playthrough amp scale hp and dmg to ridiculous numbers. to those who didn't play the original borderlans i'd recommend playing it.",0
rm -rf denuvo once developers run that command and recompile it will probably run really well.,0
payday has an alternate title that the game left out paywall go fortress,0
"pretty boring, in my opinion. but it can be fun in the end when their is tons of action. flying is pretty good in the game.",0
"on the first day i played, i played for near ten hours. that must tell something of how addicting this game is!",1
"the rd person perspective does not work for an over the top game, its not done well either in this game, they tweaked very little. your camera is over your shoulder instead of above you. imagin diablo is rd person. it just doesnt work. to focus your perspective infront of you just doesnt work with the amount of zombies attacking you and cutting off your view from your left and right gets you killed very easily and takes forever to kill big hordes. just dont get it.",0
game is nice but there's too little of maps. it gets boring after h of playing. too bad,0
"bottom line not good. certainly not good for this price point. if you're a big k fan, wait for a several months until it is on sale and is patched. this game clearly was released too soon. in multiplayer, it's almost unplayable crash, crash, crash ! the solo campaign is interesting enough, but the pacing is slow, slow, slow! i was waiting for this for months. but it's just no good. and it's embarassing that it this costly and so very, very disappointing.",0
only people you will find playing this game is yr old basement dwellers.,0
"the single player campaign of coh is average at best, especially if you compare it to the first game awesome 'band of brothers' inspired story. unfurtunetely, the mp doesn't fare much better currently it has so many dlcs and microtransactions attached to it that owning only the base game makes it impossible to be even remotely competitive online.",0
"first review i've posted here, and i do so not out of love. this game is very, very poorly executed. movement is horrid, ai is horrid, kept dropping my dragging bodies which made for tedious foot at a time drags to hiding spots, pull out your silenced weapon and feel like the most useless assassin in the world.. oh god what have they done.. come to think of it, what have i done? f ing dollars for a broken beta?",0
if you enjoy zombie games like cod zombies then don't get this game. it hardly has as much content as cod zombies and in my opinion is quite boring as there is no fun objective to the game.,0
countless punkbuster problems that they will not fix or address. you will get kicked from every server after min for loss of packets or service abnormalites. it's a great game when you can stop punkbuster from runing your time.,0
destroyed my feelings. that mountains that castles that ice that rivers that bird and that brothers just destroyed me. just think about it. f you will start this game then your life will be not same anymore.,1
"lovely, poignant, and at times distressing, journal is perhaps most interesting because of the way it reacts to your decisions. sometimes it feels as though the game, or the protagonist herself, is fighting against you. the tension created between what you want the protagonist to do and what she actually does, often in spite of the choices you make as the player, neatly underscores her own internal conflicts and the feelings of helplessness no doubt experienced by anyone going through a lot of rough stuff at home. it seems that you remain a troubled youngster no matter what you do.",1
it's high no- death cry,1
"the graphics were fine, and some of the character models were great even cossack, anyone? . the problem i have with this game is the controls or to be precise, the delay with buttons pressed. they tried to make the attacks look more natural like the fighting style, but thanks to the attack animations being mostly unique for each character, some characters have really cheap and exploitive button combos. i would recommend it if you want to watch the cpu fight each other for minutes. if wanting to play the game yourself, it shall be too annoying to like it for long.",0
dis is fun yet cancerous,1
"there's about hours of gameplay here, and that's with playing the same minutes times to gether different endings. definitely not worth more than cents.",0
"hands down one of the most amazing games i have ever played in my life. gripping story, dynamic characters, beautiful artwork and an extremely immersive story set this game apart from anything else like it. out of",1
". out of a nice shooter russia has been nuked, the apocalypse made it so that you can't walk on the surface without a gasmask. people live in the metros, but what else lives there, and what is created in the radioactive waste. great graphics, decent story - bugs, sometimes a bit too hard, a nice shooter in an apocalyptic world.",1
"i read about it very briefly, that it was meant to be a relaxing and engaging experience, and it being super cheap decided to try it. well, i should have watched videos of gameplay prior i suppose, as -the music isn't particularly soothing. yes, i know, subjective and the vast majority of people love it but it isn't hammock or artesia when it comes to helping you wind down. -the 'story piece by piece' was a series of perhaps five images didn't make it past that that i could not decipher and were as engaging as lint. -gameplay is puzzle solving, in essence problem solving. this is most of what i do at work and as it didn't appear attached to any particular feeling of escapism in my case it was like coming home to go to work.",0
worst gaming community ever and valve seem to be happy to leave it that way.,0
this game is good. kinda lick a teabag on a cold sunday night.,1
"progress is extremely hard to make, not rewarding, and certain spots if you go to them you cant get back so you have to ditch your progress. this.",0
"read read read i wont disagree with the people who say this game is amazing, ive played many video games and i can tell by just over a few hours gameplay that this is a cult clasic! but and this is a big but this game was proberly legendery to play back in but now by other games standards this game is garbage, if you've played the latest bethesda games and are looking for a new game to play this is definetly not the one for you!! i would only recomend this game to someone revisiting there favourite childhood game etc. this game makes fo look like a m sprint, fo is so slugish by todays standards of gaming that you will be bored to death in minute, if your in to more modern up beat faced past games like fo or fonv this is definelty not for you! ignore the other fanboy reviews!! in this would be a out of by todays standards including gameplay, narative, charechter models etc. not graphics for obious reasons out of complete waste of money!!",0
this is all you need to create a games,1
"i guess i am just not the type who likes games like this, maybe because i am bad at it. way too repetitive.. out of would creat the badge by trading other cards and not play this game again. if you have any questions how i gave any rating feel free to comment. please keep in mind that this is my personal preferences story acctually read about it, pretty desent dungeon crawling story gameplay voice acting music graphics depth flexibility n a reward system n a total . out of",0
i love this game even when i dont play it for years on end ..support it people..,1
"this game is great. it takes some tweeking to get it to work with windows and above, but thats a quick fix with some youtube searches. its much more than just and rpg first-person shooter. i recomend it to anyone who enjoys a good challenge",1
best game ever. totally would spend money for the in game .,0
too plain and boring. the bounces are nice though,0
"maybe not the best bridge builder game, but it works. and my year old son loves it.",1
"love this game, thousands of hours played, definitive x game..must have for any pc gamer!",1
really great game for those who love puzzlers that just make you head explode.,1
i saw that this was a great game untile kabam.,0
"i got it yesterday, steam is trying to tell me i've pllayed it . hours now i might have a problem. the most expansive racing game i've ever gotten my hands on. i originally only bought this game to tide me over till i have forza horizon , but i can see myself coming back to this game even once i start forza",1
"shhhh, be veewy, vewy quiet, i'm hunting kowechians. so one person disliked this.. that one person was a kolechian.. hehe.",1
"i haven't come to understand why it is fun to drive a virtual tractor trailer truck for hours, but surprisingly it is. the added bonus of being able to hire other drivers and buy more depots makes this game even better.",1
"a pick up and play game, lead and gold has some good points going for it very skill-based, team-supportive, and a decent variety of maps and graphics. it's a fun game, when it's not utterly chaotic. you can spawn on top of a flag that teammates carry around the map, which is both an interesting mechanic, and very frustrating, when enemies pop up in your face with a shotgun in the middle of you focusing on something else. explosions, one-hit kills, and anyone able to pop up anywhere there are no choke points in any map can make for a very random, hectic, and skill-less battle at times. but if you can put up with it's unforgiving, crazy nature, it's rewarding. unfortunately there are just a lot of games that do this style way better. the most unique thing it has going for it is the wild west. out of",0
"i'm disapointed, trine and were ok but this one has lots of bugs. can't play multiplayer because the game can't detect how many players are connected. the mage amadeus is more useless than ever, you just run behind your friends with no need of the amadeus spells. it is really difficult to move the cube. hope they fix the bugs and give amadeus some more utilities.",0
"you should know beforehand that tharsis is a game where rgn takes a huge part in what happens throughout your trip. skill and knowledge, also patience, takes part in how you perform. decisions, decisions, decisions. you will struggle and rage, maybe not even ever finish one game. if that's all fine by you then it's a great game. if not, stay away from it. from about.. playthroughs or so i got to the finish line only once. currently i'm trying to beat the game in hard mode. wish me luck. if you wish to see it in action you're more than welcome to check this video, it's a tharsis let's play",1
"bad port. to play this game properly, you must follow the wise words of our friend seaman. 'be original and buy another dreamcast.. you never know when you might need another one.'",0
"there were only one huge problem with the game before - optimization. everything else in this game were great. guess what, they changed the engine, improved graphics, and optimized the game very well. from fps to stable on highest graphical settings. totally recommend this game to anyone. and dont worry, you'll be fine even if you missed previous games.",1
this engine is so full of bugs you would need a life time of bug spray to clear them all. i backed reloaded as a gold pledger because of what was promised . which never came about and out of the blue they changed everything and came up with this. far cry was ahead of this back in years on and you get this. they took the money to develop other software. i cant see this going anywhere apart from being dropped. get your free steam gift card codes at link removed it really works!,0
stunning visuals the puzzles have just the right amount of complexity to them i didn't feel unchallenged nor frustrated . i loved it.,1
"it's too short, but it's half-life d",1
hands down one of the best if not the best rogue-like games on the market. since the release of original binding of isaac the rogue-like genre got revived and the new standards of how rogue-like games should be played and developed got set. bloody masterpiece!,1
now lemme tell ya. if ur looking for a good time learning a game more complex than insert analogy here then this is the game for you. the learning curve is rather large but it is oh so satisfying when you finally scale it. i'd reccommend this to anyone who plays mobas and is looking for something to really get their teeth into.,1
"this game played through way too quickly, and while it's a nice concept, i've played better, free flash games like it online.",0
"my exerpience was, get told everything, siriously, jumps take u up high style basic. so i start ignoring the text cos its just repetetive and such. go through the level, consisting of enemies which u have to wait to come to u to kill them. have no idea what to do next. give up cos it isnt fun anyway.",0
"this game gets difficult fast, and if you lose a life during an easy part the game, the game gives you insult. do the developper think we like being insulted while we get angry at the game ? controls literally sucks ! this game still use the arrows by default. don't waste your time on this game.",0
"it is good but i have one complaint, when ever i readjust screen size or go fullscreen in game popups and in game menu is offset and i have to restart game at time. other than that it is a good game fun to play.",1
one of the best racing games ever!,1
"the worst game i have ever played. do not buy, reasons listed in all the other reviews which i honestly wish i had read when i bought this game out of - update the devs seem to be finished with the game at this point. i don't remember seeing an update in the queue but there may have been a few. still can't recommend it - the few updates can't possibly have made it much better. please do not buy this game unless you feel like wasting . . you won't play it for long.",0
"nice game, playing with controller make it easy to play.. now come with zombie.. nice..",1
"tl dr a fun sci-fi rpg, with a dark souls amp batman mixed combat style. an interesting crafting system, tons of skills, abilities and talents to mess around with builds, a pretty good companion system and top notch graphics. audio is pretty good, voice acting is a bit dodgy but acceptable for the studio size. overall it's an enjoyable game to wittle away a few hours on, would rate it something like . out of and recommend you give it a go if you like, souls games, rpgs or sci-fi games. for a quick overview of the game mechanics and gameplay you can check out my swift spotlight video here. youtube video swift spotlight - the technomancer nbsp",1

one of the best stories i've read played in a long time. the end is really grabbing.,1
"choppy framerate, the only playable mission is the tutorial, and the game is constantly crashing. my rig isn't a damned jet engine, but it's no mid-line. this was a game that i was excited for. i was ready to lay down the exterminatus on some xenos scum. but sadly, i cannot. therefore, until the dev team fixes these issues i cannot recommend this title, and i'm honestly thinking about a refund.",0
really fun game and well worth the money i paid for it.,1
"fun game, awesone serries. wrecked by lag. if you do not have a high performance computer, don't buy this game. you will not enjoy the jerking camera, the non responsive units, delayed commands, mission critical units doing as they please, units destroied not by stupidity or cunning, but buy lag. in short, my comp runs at an average of . x better than the reccomended specs and the game now runs like . the updates have made things worse, and support tickets have not resoved any issues when they have been finnally answered. the problem persists across a number of people i play with and should you purchase the game be aware that single player and lan are the only options - internet multiplayer doesn't work consistantly and people drop from games if it takes too long to load sync place first unit - and i should mention they dont have a choice the game does it for you, even if you were first to load with highest performance on the whole, go back to the origional men of war.",0
"really good, brought me back to the ac games after skipping the third game.",1
"i've always enjoyed vector graphic style games. they just provide a classic look from those s arcade games that i cherish the most. gravitron looks really promising and feels like a cross between defender and scramble, but the keyboard and mouse controls do not make this game friendly to play.",0
just the first boss fight shows how bad this game is..,0
"don't like games that don't play fair - i start at the left of a corridor and work right, killing things as i move. don't like it when things suddenly appear from behind me in an area i just cleared. got to the second stage where i'm farting about with rockets in the sky with a blimp - didn't like the mechanic and deleted it. no loss as i didn't buy it - must've been part of a humble bundle. the music was good, however.",0
i got robbed! don't make the same mistake..,0
i cant play it it says server is enforcing consistentsy for this file models infected hulk.mdl,0
you shouldn't read the reviews of a free game. install it and give it your own opinion. ever since launch firefall has been made incredibly easy to understand and there has been a massive influx of new gamers. the only problem i can see after launch and in the future is the sheer ammount of bugs starting to get to newer players. take it from someone who's been playing a year - if you can't play what you want to play because of bugs.. give it a day wow that rhymed out of would recomend to anyone and everyone.,1

"a fun, engaging dungeon crawl. there's something incredibly engaging about learning your character's strengths and weaknesses, outfoxing your rather dumb by design enemies, gathering ever-more impressive loot to outfit yourself, and racing towards the finish line. i've sunk many a lazy afternoon into this game, and have no regrets. neither will you.",1
amazing game but i have yet to be able to play it i am very frustrated it keeps crashing before i can start my game please help,0
game has so many issues that it would take pages to post them all. the only think that is good about this game is it a new was to play multi-play killing team game. servers are so bad with ping unless you are lucky and you can play on a low ping server. there are many expliots in the game that make the fighting very unfair. really unenjoyable to play.,0

i didnt really like the game that much but my friends love it.. idk,0
"after playing it a little longer not much substance for . even worse, way too many sequence bugs, where doing things slightly out of order causes the game to essentially be corrupted and forcing a start over. don't buy until it goes on sale or until they release a major patch. original review well done and well conceived, my only complaint is that there could be more randomization, and a little more nuance to the action.",0
"this is a very original game. originality in game play is super rare these days so it was extremely fun to play and discover a type of game that i had never encountered before. not only was it original but it is really quite fun. i enjoy trying to beat the levels and learning from my failings. just a fantastic game, i definitely recommend it.",1
horrible toxic game full of toxic players from peru and russia who constantly tell you to kill yourself. never play this.,0
it's a very big mystery i mean some questions are really really hard!!but that's good.,1

"with update , it seems as if overkill really does want the best for this game. microtransactions are kill and another community bonus is announced, along with an e teaser and the announcement that payday is again totally under their control. while the game is still buggy and disconnect-y, it's still one of my favorite games, and i'll still reccomend trying it at the very least. i only hope that they don't fall into a hole like last crimefest, and as long as they avoid that, i have high hopes.",1
"game used to be fun. not anymore. pointless grinding and the money-making policies of overkill ruined it. aside from and more in dlc with overpowered weapons and weapon classes people with the vanilla version have no access to e.g. rpg, any sniper rifle, any lmg, grenades , overkill introduced a crate system similar to cs go, dota oder tf . this was 'rewarded' to the community for completing challenges set by overkill for the annual crimefest. payday is nothing but a money grab for the developers. they don't care about their players at all unless they critisize overkill in which case they will be banned from the forums and their posts deleted. this game is a rip-off similar to 'infestation survivor stories' and the like.",0
"probably the most challenging and most rewarding video game i have ever played. a true simulation of real life. you start out as bobley, you wake up in the middle of no where, and have no ing idea where you are. this doesn't matter to bobley, there is construction to be done. you get up and hop across buildings and cranes. you drive trucks and forklifts to their doom. you drive a nitrous fuled dump truck and shoot your load everywhere. the whole time you have no idea what the is going on but you slowly grow to realise that this is always going to get harder, and will never end. this is what hell looks like. theres work to be done bobley, get to it.",1
"i love this game, but no one should buy it untill they 'finish' it. it has been abandoned and if this was early access it would be amazing but to call this finished is a horrendous insult that double fine has slapped on themselves without an ounce of shame. do not buy this! do not fund double fine until they finish a game!",0
"warframe is a sci-fi rd person perspective game where some space ninjas run around and shoot, slash, and all sorts of other sci-fi stuff an evil empire and a company bent on capturing you and making you look like frankenstein ex. valkyr . so if you like fast action, intense gameplay and the occasional weird bug or glitch, this game will knock your socks off. not literally though, so you don't have to be worried about that. oh and it has cool graphics. thats really all i have to say.",1
"after mw i told myself that i would never again buy another call of duty game.. well, i did and now i hate myself. this is the worst game i have ever played! period! i can't even get normal graphics settings to work without the game automatically reverting my specs back to the lowest settings for no reason. and i have a decent gaming rig this is the worst attempt at a console port i have ever seen! what a waste of my hard earned money! do not buy this game!!",0

never played it never will out of got it from a promotion,0
it should still be a beta version. too buggy actually..warmachine is a good tabletop game but this digital version just ruin it. i played it on my new mac book pro inch. the performance is so bad that it keeps crashing. it crashes a lot..i can't even finish one level. the game ui is not easy to use and confuses me a lot. d render looks bad..i think some of my old games' d graphics are better than this one.,0

"the games a great mmo. however, the support team and the launcher are absolute . if the launcher works for you great. however if it doesn't prepare to spend the next hour of your life scrolling through about trouble shooting tips, trying vpns for the download, and temporarily disabling all firewalls security - so the damn thing doesn't time out. honestly, just not worth it - especially when this occassionally happens on patches. seriously, if games from years ago eve online, uo, etc. can patch without issues and you're game can't. get ed.",0
this game is the best that i played this game needs a rating of stars out stars because you can build ship but in other games. you have to have mods to do cool things in the others games and this game you have to be a good player to be a god in this game so i think you should buy this game i know it's . but it is worth the money so buy this game now!!,1
i like this game although i wish someday soon their will be an update fixing it becuase one issue ive had is that when im not doing work after like mins it takes away half my money so if anyone can reply back to me on that id appreciate it,1
it is really good but it has copy from doom,1
"there is nothing i would change about this game. it is an experience unlike any other and a true marriage of story and gameplay. if you're interested in a game that uses its control scheme as a way to connect with the characters and show you how they work together, look no further than brothers. i'll make just one reservation. this game is designed to be played with a controller. there is an option to use the keyboard, but i do not recommend it because the manner in which a controller functions plays an essential role in the conclusion of this masterpiece.",1
"gonna be honest, came to this without any kind of kickstarter bias and i can really say i got my money worth. i was looking forward to multi planet systems to fight over and maybe a few space battles. theres sorta that? the typical system i've run into in galactic conquest is about - planets max. each planet feels way too small. remeber taht episode of rick and morty with the tiny planet at the end of season two? imagine trying to go to war on that. i make no jokes when i say there are command and conquer maps bigger then these planets. also its not all that fun as the ai kinda sucks. and honestly i'd be mad if i had paid more then five bucks for it. in all seriousness its games like this that make me only buy games on deep deep discount sales. go buy dawn of war or something for a rewarding single player rts experience, this is only really a good buy if you super love the concept and find it for really cheap.",0

"completed all short review a game that over reaches, with different areas offered fps, tps, open world and sniping. the sniping parts of the game are kinda of fun but spread thinly over many poor areas of the game. poor development which is fine for a small developer but the innovation cannot be seen with many rough edges and too much boring and unchallenging gameplay. would put behind early android sniper games i played using tilt controls. long review youtube video sniper blacklist - sinning or winning? nbsp",0
"the game needs a hell of a lot of power to run. most recent games dont even come near the amount of bo needs. in sp i lag with hell and in multiplayer i lag in the beginning, but thats only the performance lag, now lets continue to the server lag. long story short, servers are the most ed up during the day. servers are lagging and connection is ed. and yes, this is for everyone in the servers not only me. thats sad. i need to wake up early in the morning to play this game. as with the zombies, i am not a zombie fan and dont know much about zombies so with the basic knowledge i have, i dont like zombies due to the fact that it gets repetetive. as for the last word, do i like the game? did i enjoy the game? can i reccomend the game? pros game runs decent graphics cons server connection performance issues my specs if anyone wants to compare cpu intel core i . ghz ram x gb ddr gpu amd radeon r x gb msi",0
i got kicked for having steam. what the fuk fuk!!,0
"i can clearly see why people love this game, but it's most certainly not for me. none of the game's aspects appeal to me. the combat gets repetitive very quickly, there's not much of a story, although the art style is without a doubt beautiful and the music is very romantic but i think both don't fit the cyberpunk sci-fi theme the game is going for, the gameplay basics are poorly explained and once i understood it i didn't like it, the narrator's voice is distracting i wish he'd stop talking because he never has anything interesting to say . i want to like this game maybe i will once i push through it to get all the steam achievements , but as for now i don't understand how this game got this high score. unlocked all achievements!",0
"banned without reason from the heroes generals forums. -.- i've played this hours, and after new updates i cant even start the game, it doesnt run. no one helps me, no one tells me why. plus before that they ruined the game by some stupid squad system. goodbye heroes generals. it was fantastic couple of years and hours and lots of money spent.",0

"this game is actually not that bad, i mean, the story and humor is only good if you're a teenage boy or have the mind of one , but i actually enjoyed it. that is, until i figured out that when you start the game using an xbox controller , it starts on new game. when you start new game, it deletes your old game file. hours of my life lost because of a simple mistake.",0

"this tries to be both a first person shooter and an economy trading game..it does both badly. its poorly executed in every way possible. the controls are bad, the economy is a random crap shoot, the fps levels are generic and monotonous. the story is so bad it seems like it was written on the back of a th graders trapper keeper. and whoever voiced the characters should be court ordered to communicate vie hand gestures only. to top it all off the character models are hideous. this game is not worth . c play some free flash games if you need to kill time that badly. out of i suppose i would play it if my choice was play this game or be locked in an airplane toilet for hours but that's only if i didn t have a year old newspaper.",0
"this game made me question my sanity, it lacks depth, characterization, most of all, it lacks fun. it isn't bland per say, but this is only because it is entirely nonsensical, it still manages to be overly cheesy and not a pleasant experience. while free to play i can't advise you spend your time here.",0
"this game has a really good concept, which was sadly ruined by a half- interface. the turn based tactical rpg combat would be great if the movement wasn't so screwy..so yeah. i wouldn't suggest buying this game. in fact, i only own it because it came free with my tropico pre-order.",0

this game not deserve euro with a bunch of people with hackz and steam do nothing to ban them but they ban the good people without hackz logic of cs go .,0
"humor writing went from actually being well blended and good to being memetacular garbage. gameplay definitely feels more polished, but loot uses an exponential curve instead of a linear one, which kinda sucks. probably worse than the first game overall, but the polish helps make up for it. again, play with a friend, not a group.",1
overall a very fun game. i would say that its worth it when its on sale but not at normal price. i would definitely pick it up!,1
"i would write a nice and useful review but no time for this, gotta search for ciri.",1
definitely a game that will help you pass the time. for the price i'd say go for this game!,1

"at on sale i decided to see what truely lay behind the hype and the slander. i am now leaning towards the slander side. this game runs horribly on my mid-high range system, worse than fsx, fsx se and p d v . it looks horrible and other than the aircraft texturing it looks a lot like stock fsx, and runs just as poorly. dovetail needs to get rid of the fsx base code they aquired, and move to working with the ms flight code that they also aquired, once they do that i feel they will make it where ms didn't. however they need to open it up to rd party development, and allow the same freedom of creation that has kept fsx and p d in the market for over years.",0
i would not recommend this game in its current state.. it needs alot of work on balance before its actually gonna be enjoyable.. for one the most squishy character is the so called tank his first weapon has over dps at level in comparisson to his later weapons that are around .. as a test i tried playing with the tank at level and hex at level and hex took on average two more hits from the same enemy before he died .. and he is the ranged dps .. the first ability that the support has some sort of defense turrets do more damage and has alot more hp then the tank.. i was realy looking forward to this game and in its current state i would not even play it through if i got it for free .. and that is realy a shame .. i hope that this game gets the care it deserves and at that point i might try it again .. but for now .. its a major dissopointment..,0
this game suckes iv been tring to log on for an hour and once i did that it wouldnt even let me type a username,0

"make sure you have a friend s who own this game or you literally will have to win the lottery on finding someone who is cool enough to accept you as one of their own. you will most likely not get anywhere, otherwise. sales for this game are sparse, but still happen occasionally. try and snag it then if you're not willing to lay down for it. i bought it when it was pre-greenlight, though, so whatever floats your boat. community is pretty , though, so good luck.",1

what a horrible and buggy affair this game is. i have a state of the art rig and can't even get past entering my name. it locks up each and every time. the menus in the options screen are horrible and setting the different resolutions in the game is a lesson in futility. avoid this one like the plague.,0
"oh look! another game that ain't so great but will be praised regardless for its undertones! yes, this whole game is a giant metaphor for a boy and his fears in a family with substance abuse. quite tragic, no joke, and perhaps meaningful to people who have experienced that but this doesn't mean it makes for a good, fun, or even thought provoking game. in the end i was put off by slow, clunky gameplay with repetitive and regurgitated puzzles that eventually bored me to uninstall point. it's cheap but even then i wouldn't recommend this game.",0
best games ever to much free time,1
i can't figure out how to download direct x or play the game,0
"what a hidden gem of a game! original story, excellent gameplay, and it require the use of your brain. i couldn't stop playing. true to the rpg genre, there is more than one track the character can take. seperate skills allow for some customization to individual tastes. for a game from a small, obviously underfunded studio in germany, this is exceptional. there are some bugs, and the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but it doesn't detract from the experience. having played the english version, i don't know what may have been lost in translation. on the upside, the developers have an open relationship with users. they are working on possible patches for the technical issues and take player input seriously. ultimately, love this game! out of for sure. i look forward to the next masterpiece from deck . great job guys, keep it up!",1

"this game is incredible, it's the most fun shooter to come out in a while. the guns and strategems all feel fun and different, and it's great trying out different builds and working well within a team or just being a jack of all trades. the feeling of anxiety and dread you get playing a tough level is something that's hard to produce in most games, and when the hits the fan it gets even better. the dangerous nature of the team, between friendly-fire and constant drop pods is definitely a great aspect, as well as often being hilarious. plus nothing makes you feel cooler than holding out for the drop ship, back to back surviving waves, or dropping right into the thick of the enemy crushing three of them with your drop pod and gunning down the rest, turning the tide of the fight for your squad. literally my only complaint is that they didn't sell a -pack for , so that i could give copies to my friends.",1
"i purchased this game based on the graphics shown within the trailer. it looked like it held potential to be a wonderfully beautiful game. upon playing, this was by far one of the worst games i've played. i'll admit, i'm not a huge gamer but the graphics are extremely glitchy, the controls function poorly, i do not like how i cannot easily exit from the game, and there is no explanation upon start to even clue you in on what controls you need for basic use of the game. i had a decently confusing time figuring out the first platform simply because as someone that does not frequently play many different games, i was unsure of what the controls were. then there are spots that you can fall into deep 'holes' and there is simply no way to jump out. this is not a game i would recommend at all. even if it is cheap, i would say, don't waste your money on it and spend your money elsewhere.",0

"don't be fooled by that co-op tag, this game is not co-op in any enjoyable way. unless you enjoy watching your friend do complicated, drawn-out puzzles for minutes then do not play this game with others. there is no split-screen or way to view your character while your friend plays theirs, you can only view one at a time. during certain parts of the game it forces you to play a single character for an entire level, leaving any friends you might be playing with to sit and be forced to watch you try and figure it out for the entire duration. the levels are also unnecessarily big for what they need to be, leaving you to run around up and down ladders and ropes just to extend the play time. this game might be enjoyable by yourself if you like running climbing simulators, but i didn't find anything enjoyable about it at all. i'm glad i bought it on sale and it's definitely not worth the standard price.",0
"i saw the reviews saying this game was dead. then i thought hey, there's probably a couple of servers to play on! no. there are no servers. no reason to buy this as the game has playability.",0

"a well executed rpg which will blow you away. this is only a short game, however the storyline is so well written, it feels like you've been playing for weeks. the game has a beautiful mood complimented on all levels with a fantastic art style. there are many ways to make this game a lot harder while playing, giving appeasements to varied deities make the game a real challenge. however the average player will not find this a huge challenge. the varied weapons in the game keep enough interest in the fighting, however it might get a bit hack-n-slash toward the middle. the best part of this game is probably the narrator who explains the situations and sums up the mood for the entire game. far from getting annoying though, he adds epic. the music in this game is so beautiful and well-written it is only outdone by the artwork. so good in fact that i am downloading the soundtrack. dark, bright, colourful, grey, somber, funny. this is perfectly balanced and i cant recommend it enough!!",1
"simple and rewarding, especially when your risky combination of virtual pet action-rpg for the vena oasis turns out to be a out of masterpiece and saves your company from bankruptcy. the background story that ties into game dev tycoon gives a faux history of the gaming industry, which is amusing but also allows you to interact with it as you choose which systems and markets to capitalize on. the lack of research points i often experienced was annoying though, and i wish you earned more so you could train your employees more often. the good simple but can be challenging making good games is rewarding allusions in 'story' to gaming industry are fun the bad - never enough research points - out of out of review scores if you're a fan of management style games or have ever thought about making your own games, you'll probably like this. it's tons of fun and great for short intervals or long periods of time.",1

"chains is a great puzzle game about chaining together large links of colored balls. there are different levels, with different difficulty levels. very fun for . usd. variety is not an issue in chains, you will find yourself using your mouse as quickly as possible, other times you will be trying to find the best way to get a certain color as indiginant to the level as possible. the sound track is well done, but is repeated constantly if you have been on a level for some time. the art style is great and doesn't hurt my eyes. but occasionally, there are some framerate stutters that ruin the flow of the game. p.s. do not go into full screen mode, the screen goes black and flickers and you can't do anything while that happens. pros fun, challenging, strategic, variety, cheap cons framerate stutter, fullscreen mode, soundtrack repeat overall . out of",1

"after playing dungeon defenders. this is a dissapointement for me. im quite dissapointed in the fact this is more made to go online and play with strangers. but if you play with strangers, there are many bugs in the game. wich is quite the let down to play it. altho the new stuff in there new levels, pet hatching, weapons it is quite oke. but i still prefer the normal dungeon defenders just because of the bug reasons. if there was a button on would you recommend it-- gt not yet. this is what it should be. it should be more updated before it went live. i dced a lot of times or got black screens. if they work on this, the game will be worth getting.",0
main quest ending a little poor but overall very good,1
very arcady and not in a fun way. very few police chase races. most of the carieer races are either time attack or just race with no police. i have played . hours only so maybe it gets better later in the game but i will never know because i can't force myself to play this game.,0

"played the game for an hour but was honestly way too complicated off the bat. in my experience complicated f p games tend to be pay to win games which is probably why it was so hard to gauge weather i could win a battle on the field or not. the 'tutorial' isn't a tutorial but a few objectives for you to complete on the starter continent which still leaves you basically clueless when it comes to classes, currency, weapons, attatchments, abilities, vehicles, etc. basically everything . i feel the multiplayer experience wasn't on par with even older fps shooters. save money for bf cod gt planetside",0

"i'll preface this review by saying that i'm an insatiable fan of the horror, thriller, and suspense genres of video games and movies. the first three times i played, i didn't survive through the first night. the fourth time i played, i lived until am on the second night, then that lovely bear got a hold of me. the score music is intense. graphics are ok. gamplay is basic. overall, the game is unnerving, and i'll continue to play, as each time i pee a little, and hopefully one day beat the game.",1
"napoleon total war is a very interesting strategy game where you control a nation during the napoleonic wars. the game is focused on battles, but you can still control your nation's diplomacy, technology, and much more. it is a very fun and engaging game, and i find myself becoming immersed whenever i play it.",1
"the binding of issac is one of those games that keeps you playing, you die a bunch as is a rogue type game. but the fact that everything is randomized makes every time you play unique. it's easy enough to understand the mechanics, just shoot and move, but as enemies appear there's always something to be surprised by.",1
"i bought this game because it looked like an alright platformer and it was on sale. but this game is charming and fun. though i haven't gotten to the tougher parts yet, the simple level design and even simpler story elements add a very tight and streamlined feel to this game. the writtings on the wall are hilarious and present a really fresh twist on effective story telling i have not seen in a while maybe since the ratman in portal .",1
"i heard a lot of hate going into this game, but its plain and simple, some classic total war. i really enjoy the challenge of dealing with all these evil roaming hordes. it makes fighting on different fronts much more challenging. you never know where attila and his horde will show up and raze your cities to the ground. especially if you're taking cities that don't belong to your faction. you could invest so much into a city and then watch it all burn. it really makes you feel the loss and revenge threfore is so much sweeter. if you like previous total war games, its great. if you've never tried total war before, its as good a place to start as any other. fantastic rts.",1
"i like this game already, played it with a friend just bought it. like it!! its a great stealing, trolling and griefing simulator!",1
this game is amazing and i love it! but it is a little gross for some people and i don't recomend it to people who grossed out very easly. also can someone help me i never get the cellar basement so pls help it makes no sense why other people get the basement and i don't,1
"ever since i bought this game i have not been able to play it once. i use a dualshock controller every setting is correct. i can navigate through menus and everything but when i get into a game i cant do anything, my player wont move pass shoot etc.. i can still press esc go out of the game and so but not move players and stuff.. this should be fixed.",0

great game! story driven game where you play as if you're in a movie.. very addictive and i sometimes have the feeling that stephen king had a hand in it.. a very good story up to where i am and i really have to focus sometimes at both the game and the story ..,1
"if i had to describe the main aspects of the game in one sentence it would probably sound like this climb, collect and fight sometimes. this doesn't sound too exciting, but.. i really enjoyed this game. it's not as story driven as the sands of time games, but this doesn't mean that there is no story at all. in fact this game has a beautiful way of providing the player with background lore, as long as you let the two protagonists talk to each other once in a while. the world is beautifully designed and offers more and bigger open areas than the sands of time trilogy, although they are quite linear. smaller indoor sections like rooms in a castle or a dungeon are relatively rare in this game. the combat system isn't as dynamic as in sands of time and while fighting bosses extremely quick-time-event based. however, this is not a major letdown, since the main gameplay consists of exploring and acrobatically climbing through the world. at last something, which is very important to me. this game does not require u-play.",1
"normally an awesome game, but it doesnt seem to be working on my lap top. ive tried a variety of tips to fix it but all i can do is get to the main menu before the game crashes. i have oficially wasted ten dollars on a great game that i cannot play, thanks steam for selling it to me. so i highly reccomend not buying this game becasue it seems like many people have the same problem i ran into.",0
"i really really wanted to like this game. first off i'm a big fan of baldur's gate and all it's expansions. coming into this game perhaps i got my hopes up too much. state of the game i thought the graphics were beautiful. i found the ui, and voice acting good. the story medicore, the ending was horrible. the ending of this reminded me of nwn vanilla's ending. rushed i would state what i disliked about the story and ending, but i dont care to drop spoilers for the few who havn't played this yet. get it on a steam sale. don't pay full price.",0
"amazing story and voice-over. combat might be a bit tricky for those not used to tactical pause-and-play rpg strategy gaming. you need to pause quite a bit and move your characters away from red-colored damage areas if you don't want your party to get 'wiped'. have i said that the story and voice-over was amazing yet? because yes, it really was. in some scenes i was literally in tears. i was like 'wth?!' why are cartoony pictures and voice-over acting dialogue affecting me so much?! so yeah.. the script was that good.",1

entertaining overall but short and without much replay value. it is evident that you are on path the entire game. the claim of 'choices that affect your journey' are limited to a small set of consequences that overall have very little impact on the game. picking a different choice may lose gain some men or supplies but i've never once been in danger of losing the game. you often have to choose between leveling up your character or having supplies to feed your caravan.. this makes no sense!,0
great fun! the interface is a bit confusing due to the large font size and buttons. the gunplay is meaty!,1
"anyone with a facebook page should play this. great commentary on the age of the internet where privacy may very well be just an illusion we feed ourselves. it's also an interesting twist on the idea of a power fantasy. you don't have big guns or magic powers, you have personal information of everyone at your finger tips. and information is power no? be prepared tho for a somewhat guided experience. to keep the story in line, there are only chosen lines of text that you can pick out, but you still have the power to pick whether or not you include some of them. main issue i have with this otherwise smart game is that it's a little difficult to keep track find data you chose to not pick out because you previously thought it wasn't relevant. and it's kinda hard to tell what data will move the story forward vs what is data that you can leave out to change the outcome.",1
"this game is the worst multiplayer game i've ever played in my life. paywalled content, boring intial ships, bad interface, slower gameplay, terrible explanation of game functions, useless tutorial, the list goes on. wasted hours of my life i will never get back. who would spend money on a pos game like this? learn from dota, idiots, don't paywall content. devs suck. bg no re.",0

"the online multiplayer is far from perfect. but it functions. as i progress through arcade mode i just leave the fight finder on. usually doesnt give me time to get one ultimate combo finish in before i am being challenged. im sitting around wins in online fights. so its doing something right for me. going for the achievements is fun. gives you a goal. though i will never get them all and i know this, i am sad that i was seduced inro spending more dollars on this game to upgrade it to ultimate. i could see the achievements for ultimate when my game was actually running ssfivae. so i paid for characters, a couple stages, the ability to get more achievements, and the ability to choose my ultimate combo preference. also i think the online multiplayer got harder after i updated to usfiv. suddenly i was being challanged by higher grade opponents, even with the finder set to 'same skill'. but in the end i keep turning this game on and enjoying it lately. its a fighter. turn it on, play out your luck, turn it off before it gets frustrating.",1
do not play if you have bad internet that its ping drops then goes back!!,0

"unfortunate that i need to express how deeply saddened i am that this game is basically abandoned, by it's developers and it's potential players. personally i couldn't get past the main screen for the resolution being off and the mouse doesn't click where it's supposed to therefore i couldn't exit the game normally either , but this game was designed for windows out of and hasn't been updated since october . i was looking forward to playing something reminiscent of 'myst' or 'the endless forest'",0

"i'm gonna be honest, the game is pretty decent, but the problem is that if you've already played civ , then you've played this game already. the game you really wanted to play a polished, fresh, interesting twist on an old genre is endless legend. the good stuff it's civ, and prob has most of the things you like about civ, and throws in a bell or whistle or two. the affinity branches are kind of cool but you the bad stuff it's just civ. with more irritating barbarians labled as aliens. nothing really changes the way the game is played, so it doesnt feel fresh or interesting. modders come up with equally interesting, and totally free content. might be worthwhile when theres more dlc out for it?",0

better than cod ghosts out of actual review below this is a spin-off of the very popular counter-strike series. at first it looks like crossfire with the goldsrc engine. i'll go over the pros and cons. pros - it's free - it can run on crappy computers - crafting gives you free temporary weapons - classic cs action with zombie modes - very popular cons - pay to win - unbalenced teams sometimes eg ts are payers and cts are f ps - everyone camps in zombie mode - menu is laggy on crappy computers - hackers possibly overall i give this an out of it's not perfect but it's very fun in bite sized chunks.,1

best ubi game on steam!,1
"i will write another review after this because there will probably be some updates soon as of this review it is july th . ok first off this game is wonderful and the jumpscares always get me which is what i want from a 'horror' game and this game takes the cake it is the best, scariest, darkest, story wise and hardest fnaf game i will try not to spoil anything the only problem with this game is the sounds of the animatronics 'breathing' were very hard to hear i think that should be fixed so people can have the best experiance. but all in all this game was the best because this game answered every last question i had warning spoilers!! . answered what animatronic bit the child . how the bite of happened . found out who fredbear is . found out who golden freddy freadbear is . who was the victom of the bite and finaly . actualy gave me nightmares i would give this game a out of if i could hear the breathing then i would go out of wonderful and beautiful work scott can't wait to see what you do next!",1
this game is so ..,0
"i don't remember where i heard it, but it captures the game pretty well. in its 'fixed' state. 'it feels like you're yelling your instructions to your character from a very long distance.' i've never really had this problem with other ac titles, but in this game it feels like you have very little control over your character. optimization problems have been patched so framerates are playable, at the cost of severely crippled graphics compared to, say, black flag. it's a shame, because the story is actually interesting. not interesting enough to put up with the awful mechanics, though.",0
"hours played, fun game would replay again",1
this game looks like it would be for a middle schooler who hasn't gotten out of the 'chuckling at the word '' phase' but it really isn't. this game insues hilarity every time you play it and even when you play it without friends. this game also has a ton of replayability as in the mounts are never the same game by game so literally the fun will never end. out of game.,1
a very fun and intersting game with well made story. its a little short if you dont do side quest. play it with your best buddy instead of yourself!,1
bought the game the night before launch. upon launch it was off. extremely lame strategy that f cks over long-time fans. not sure who thought up this scheme but i hope it backfires in a big way. game also has teleporting enemies in some areas and pretty bad frame rate drops in open areas.,0
demo crashs everytime i play it.,0
"this game is a bit fun for one hour or so, it is so simple and lacks any depth that you will find no reason to continue playing it more than an hour. the tracks are very short, laps take - seconds, and each race takes - minutes. the upgrades are very expensive so you keep playing repeadly until you get enough money to buy upgrades.",0

omg i love this game every one if you like rts buy it!!,1

"visual out of story out of rmg - out of in general, i will say good game, but gona give it no, do to game breaking moments.",0
"i have hours on record. i would not recommend this game to anyone. the game has been in development for years and there is a forum giving bugs and issues that players have. some of the bugs are still unfixed after year, clearly when they are patching, its just to generate more money. they are not patching to increase playability eg. you cannot play on a resolution higher than x as this is considered cheating, even though you could have players with x do not, i mean do not even install and try this game. its that game that you will love and hate at the same time. then when you keep on loosing game after game after game due to their really really bad match making system where you will play as a bronze player pitted against diamond players. this is no fun what so ever!",0

its a fun platformer that at first looks relaxing and simple but it will be the most insane and incredible hard platforming game you will ever play in your life. multiplayer is fun because you get to watch other people fail and paint the entire level red with blood.,1
"while the game is by no means awful, it's by no means good or memorable. it's a typical arena brawler with good controls but it offers nothing more then button mashing controls. i have played through the remake of the orginal game offered here on steam and while there offered a lot of chram and parody to a bunch of embarassing moe fan service, this only offers fan service has the story is not funny outside of a scene involving blanc humilating noire over an embarassing youtube video the game is simply not funny . the only memorable thing is that every speical move done in this game often times leads to a liften skirt or dress to expose the girls panties nepgear does this a lot full review here",0
"ah, the good life. as you may see from this video, it looks wonderful. first, i need steam trading cards for this game. they're like sunken treasure. but anyway.. imagine a world where you take enormous amounts of money from people to transport them between tropical islands in an archepelago, flogging them food and drugs along the way. well, here it is. you are completely in charge, to the point where if you want to abandon ship halfway through transporting them to go diving for treasure, you can. you probably shouldn't, but you can. it's the sort of nonsense i love. and it is, nonsense. if you are looking for an in-depth business or management sim, this is not it. this is for relaxing with in a moment of downtime. and it would be relaxing, if it weren't for the tornados, pirates, and screaming drowning people. but let's not talk about them. it's too harrowing.",1

"i have been looking forward to this game since it showed up at e ..in which i honestly say it was not worth the wait or the money. it took me about hours to beat the game with out of achievements when i was not even trying to. keeping things short, the only major flaws would be that investigating can become a 'click on everything' moment due to it being difficult at times to tell if something is useable or a pointless object, and the gameplay gets incredibly repetitive after a while and feels like it was added to keep players busy..also, the big 'twist' to the end of the game wasn't a very good one, so please consider waiting for it to drop in price before a purchase.",0
this game is buged you cant even get past boss randomly i die for going in the teleporter!,0

there is only one game mode that ppl play.,0
"i usually don't like fps, but i really liked this game. the over the top story, gore, hilarious one liners, and gameplay, just adds to the fun. and what more can you ask for when you can run around and chop up demons with a katana. i would say the gameplay gets bland after doing the same thing for hours, still recommend tho.",1
"terrible game! extremely dated graphics for with broken physics and a.i. terrible, just not fun at all. nothing like the original even ignoring the graphics . remember, the original allied assault came out around ? this looks like it's using the same engine. the problem is the physx installation which is impossible using a more recent nvidia driver. maybe it runs fine with a radeon, i wouldn't know. i would stick with the console release of this game and skip this one on steam--it's too high maintenance.",0
"i was a heavy player of wipeout hd fury on ps .. technically, the only thing ok for the game is the fps which is sustain fps. come on guys, where is the bits native build! the gameplay seems not finished, or is quite strange. basically, you must not miss the speed pads, there is no real -gravity flying mechanics physics to master, that's dangerous, because it would make the game quite uninteresting. i have a few rendering bugs on the radeon open source driver radeonsi . the music is ok, the fps is ok or course, but the gfx is poor, poor. wipeout hd fury is rendered on a years old gpu and it looks times better and runs at fps too, come on guys! conclusion there is still a ton of work to do to bring that game 'up to speed'. i'll check it on a regular time basis, meanwhile i cannot honestly recommend it.",0

a vulgar attack on people who have ben through or have emotional issues or are in distress. this game narrates through the begging as if it is to fix a disorder. the end result is leaving one with a vision that is an endless demoralizing situation that would have only been corrected by immediately going to 'heaven.' not the message i was hoping.,0
finally a good sonic game. very good replay value. very cheap also. pc is the only version with p. doesn't take much to run it. it does get boring after a while but any game does.,1
"it's a good game, very pretty. the electro gun is good, easy to make into a god weapon. downside is the game doesn't last very long, and it just ends. there's no real closure or anything. it just stops. overall pass if anything, get it from an indie bundle as of writing, the indie gala has it",0

"this game was so much fun with a great combat system with silly ragdoll-decapitation physics. but then.. patch after patch, 'fixes' that broke more the game even more. crap optimization. nerfing classes instead of improving the bubble system among other things. messing with hitboxes, increasing decreasing stamina usage that give certain classes a real disadvantage. desyncing attack animations that are just beyond the worst. ever since that crap gb update toward late last year to early this year, this game hasn't been very fun. for me, it was the patches that ruined the game. almost every death will leave you asking 'uhhhhm ok? how did i not block that?' or something along those lines.",0

"a short game well worth the original price. your objective is to kill groups of enemies in the bloodiest and fastest way possible, and you'll have an assortment of weapons to help you achieve this goal. you can just run through the game, but carelessness doesn't net you high marks and often results in death. a little effort into planning goes a long way and can make this a very enjoyable game. aside from game play, the story, the music, and the graphics immerse you in its own quirky little world. the developers made something really interesting here. beating the game and meeting certain achievements unlocks new masks which unlock new abilities, so replay can give old levels a reason to play through again. just seeing this game on sale made me want to write this review in case my friends were considering buying this game. this game is worth buying.",1

"the engine is literally not changed in the slightest from the original game, which is basically grounds enough for a thumbs down since the engine was in serious need of fixing before. aside from that. the levels are generally better this time around, more action and less tedious waiting games. the boss is also way way better than anything in the original and actually fun and all that, so props on that. i can't say it's that bad level-design wise though there's still some stupid things like no spare hits in stage and lots of moments where you're expected to predict the future especially in regards to what path to go . the difficulty is pretty even throughout, about the same as the third world of the original game. if i were judging based on the level design alone i probably would recommend this but because the developers saw fit to push out a new game before fixing the previous problems i can't recommend it on policy.",0

this is the worst tom cruise simulator ever.,1
"don't even know what to think about this game. of course it comes from the same people who made warz and they use the same models and still have a horrible problem with scaling objects. ffs the bar is head level, the door of the suv is larger than the character, and the military medkit is the size of a small child it really seems like whoever is developing this game just said it when they put the models into the world. on the other hand it isn't nearly as shaddy as warz with microtransactions where they sell ammo and it just so happens that ammo is hard to find. you will not have the same problem finding ammo and guns in this game, which is a welcome change to their formula. the game is average overall and it is shame that their previous work will mean this game will never get a real shot at being popular. not mad i bought it but i am not particularlly happy either. judging by their player count and steam ranking i doubt this game has any longevity or developer support. good try sergey titov and weird hat guy, good try.",0

"the concepts for a solid game are all here, but this is very cheaply made, unpolished, and poorly balanced. controls and physics are extremely sensitive, leading to you spending most of the game overcorrecting the ball's movement. i had to adjust the mouse sensitivity on a per-level basis. the mouse cursor leaves the game boundary when trying to whip the camera around too quickly. it's easy to accidentally click the mouse and restart the level. everything has really basic textures, simplistic music, and stock sound effects. the game minimizes when you click away from it, which is pain when trying to stream it. this game is playable in the most technical sense of the word. it could've been a fun experience with more time and attention. you might enjoy it if you're looking to beat an obnoxiously challenging game out of spite. if so, good luck!",0

this game is fun but stop making fandoms and being a okay,1
"my god this game is going to go on for years to come, cant get enough of it, mods are epic making the game even better!",1
awesome game to play..enjoyed it.,1
i personally love this game,1
"the bosses where interesting, the music, atmosphere. i didnt like the combat, dark souls combat was better for me i , dark souls with bloodborne dont go well i the story is interesting, but the endings only one interesting for me and i got by summoning the firekeeper. overall i say dark souls is better for me. dark souls is god but meeehh at the same time",1
first played this on xbox.. its a wonderful game..but the respwans spoil its wonder.. if i could get a mod to change that one thing.. it would be completed and getting a thumbs up.but as yet no patch or mod. mmm thats a shame coz this could be a wonderful holiday in africa with adventure.. but instead its just game on the shelf of my steam collection.,0
this game its the best,1
"if you no like this game than.. well, that's just to bad..",1
hilarious!! stop what you are doing and buy this game. my wife and i were dying laughing playing co-op.,1
it's a very nice and relaxing game. although ot happens from time to time were evrything decide to attack me and i get stressed out but other then that it is a very relaxing game were you just run around in space reviving planets. it isn't to complicated either so that you are able to sit back relaxed and enjoy the simplicity of the game.,1
"so yeah they asked me to come to great britan for the holiday season and let me tell you, there's nothing 'great' about it. first off why there hell is there a ing santa clause walking around with a minigun? what the videogames this is supposed to be a dark look at the soldiers of modern war, not a santa shooter! there's all kinds of christmes cheer too what the hell i'm not a christian and this game is trying to force christmas t down my throat constantly. last time i checked that's religious persecution i'll see you in ing court killeng flour! . out of",1
single player amp multiplayer! this game is great!,1
one of the only games to keep my attention for so long definatly worth droping a few bucks on this to support the developers for there repetitive but adictive game. think mass effect multiplayer only better much better,1
"this game has some nice models and sounds, but the amount of strange glitches, and lack of features make my opinion. im sorry, but this game needs some work. thank you.",0
bad things - fps cap is very annoying.. good things -evrithing excluded fps cap.,1
hideous pile of garbage if it doesn't work straight off the bat demand a refund otherwise kiss your life goodbye as you'll waste an eternity with crap tech support who eventually will just stop responding. disgusting behaviour and absolutely the last of the series i'll ever buy. also runniong a moderately high spec rig with dual titans so don't tell me i may be underpowered,0
"simply put, one of the most immediately addicting games i have ever played gorgeous and cleverly designed tables galore. if you don't like pinball, you probably won't enjoy this title. it does innovate, but it doesn't change what it is at it's core. endless replayable hi-score fun. original tables from the dev's with rich themes and additions that wouldn't be possible on a real table. graphics and sounds are what you would expect. leaderboards and stats galore. -from what i can tell, no real life tables. those seem to be the focus of the other pinball game on steam, pinball arcade. unfortunately, that game charges an insanely high amount for their table recreations - but that's exactly what they are, recreations of real tables, which is what pinball fx lacks. my main gripe is that some tables made by zen for pinball fx are a little broken, whereas the tables in pinball arcade are based on real life tables which seem to be balanced better overall. the tables in pinball fx are sold at a very fair price.",1
"honestly the most enjoyable singleplayer story i've experienced in a fps in a very long time. however, if you're looking for a game series with a complete end, the whole half-life series isn't for you.",1
"i had no idea what this game was. in fact, i never heard anything about it until i had it pop up in my steam store page. i decided to try it based on all the positive buzz it was receiving. what i got was an amazingly beautiful sleeper pick. it reminded me of myst in the sense of exploring a gorgeous world and trying to solve puzzles to advance the story. ethan's story is mysterious and dark, and the puzzles are an interesting mix of exploration and observation skills. another example of games being artistic. bravo astronauts. bravo.",1
like where the hell is the change username button didnt even get a chance to fix my username,0
this game is awsome get it now!!,1
give better servers! at least then we can finally play this game..,0
"i only recommend it for the singleplayer. online is a poorly executed, not very well thought out mess. edit after months of controvercy regarding online as well as rockstar's customer support, i can't recommend this game anymore. rockstar has no idea how to run an online game, they falsely ban innocent players and if they write a support ticket - they suspend them from writing those as well. whilst i love the game for the singleplayer, i can't support these anti-consumer practices anymore. you should pirate this game, online is a pile of garbage, and the main plus of the game is the singelplayer - do yourself a favour any buy something else.",0
absolutely visually stunning game! i just wish it were longer!,1
"i really wait this game to play. but disappoint me so much. first of all. i cant play game. it is not opening healty. no fullscreen or screen calibration option. game is crashing every time, sorry sid you massed up. you will lose so much fan this time.. i hope you and your team try to change something right. dont buy this game. its not working. its worth than beta..",0

"my friend just keeps buying me these games man.. review it was clearly made using paint and minutes of a lunch time. it consists of mashing your mouse an ungodly amount of times to successfully fap, whilst building up a bonus on your fap-meter. if you hit x points your bed might break or you'll friction burn your junk, which makes sense i guess? the game itself is pretty boring, it's nothing but mouse mashing then occassionally pressing wasd when you hear footsteps, that's it. also you have to have an arm wrestle after you fap? additionally, pressing esc does not pause the game for settings, it just outright closes the game with no warning. this is a meme flash game that only exists to gift your friends when you want to have a laugh but lacks any proper gameplay other than button mashing. but at least it's priced right, so i can't be mad at the developers for that",0
"a pretty simple game, yet very fun. this is basicly genocide simulator . you have to nuke major cities and there are these defcon's. defcon and are both where you get to place units and move units. defcon and is when the warfare starts. and defcon is when you commit a nuclear holocaust and nuke the enemy cities. meanwhile, perfectly awhere that they are nuking real life cities with some of the most deadliest and most devastatingly destructive weapons of mass destruction, known as nukes, and atomic bombs.",1

"sweet. i had written a positive review before. but things changed now. what do we get at the first day of crimefest? microtransactions. why do we get that on the first day? because overkill hopes that we will forget about it when they release the rest of the 'free' content. the community is very angry and rightfully so. modders have been screwed over by overkill too. don't believe me? search for pd stats. it's no longer there. the reason? the fbi files system overkill implemented was almost an exact copy of pd stats. the modder was informed that an update like this would come in the feature, but he was reassured by overkill stuff that they wouldn't steal his ideas. well guess what? almir and his ing beard lied. this reduced the income of the modder and the site was closed. follow the story here if you wish . overkill used to be better than this. right now they are saying a huge you to the community. don't buy their payday content. it's not worth it.",0
really addictive gameplay. quick and action packed. music also very well done,1
you're an idiot if you buy and play this.,0
"what a masterpiece. me and my best friend have been long, long time behemoth fans and castle crashers is one of our favorite games of all time. so imagine our excitement upon learning about battleblock theater. we had a sleepover and we got it hours after it released. turns out, my friend didn't like the gameplay at all, even though he did love the story. but me? i loved it, and still do today. such a hilarious game with the usual behemoth charm, with amazing gameplay and ways to change it up. you can customize your character in countless ways and use golden yarn to buy new tools to bring to the table. i've completed the game on twice now. what an amazing game. out of .",1

"in a pvp game, it's important that each player has to at least play by the same rules. this is not the case with this game. certain game mechanics are different for different operating systems. this gives an advantage to mobile gamers by necessity. i would not recommend this game. it's a naked cash grab and on a pc you have little change against a mobile gamer who isn't absolutely terrible. i, being a fan of tower defense games and the bloons series, am very disappointed. uninstalling now.",0

"ftl, this is no exaggeration one of the best and i mean the best game i have played in a long time, and in my view just go buy it now, but if you need some convincing what makes this game great is. . the emerging storyline, with only a loose story you create your own story about the uss dftba and it's fate of being destroyed by asteriods. . the gameplay, the gameplay is fantastic the lasers feel hard hitting, the animations are amazing and the pause system allows you to sit down and think. not to mention the different combat styles, boarding, hacking, drones, ftl allows you to do what you want to do in combat making it truly breathtaking. . the graphics while retro give the game its own feel and it makes the game feel nicer. so, are you convinced yer?",1
horrible gameplay!! destroyed the series and wont return my money!! full of game crashes and bugs. specially start menu.,0
like gta and acrack head had a baby. then the baby was abducted by aliens that were on cocaine. and then thq made an amazing game in a completely unrelated incident.,1
"like the others in the series, it employs the lazy and uninspired 'generate endless amounts of enemies' mechanism, which is, ultimately, just a cover for poor game design, using a cheap trick to try and force you onto a specific rail and play style instead of giving you the freedom to play the game as you see fit.",0
"out of would play again this is an edit to get a badge, game is still good recent update is challenging but fun",1
"if you have played games like combat arms or alliance of valiant arms than you have already played this game. this game doesnt bring anything new and has some problems. -the camo isnt good. everyone can still see you from verry far away -movement is clunky especially jumping -lag is a huge problem for both the one lagging and the one that isnt. sometimes i could shoot someone a full clip point blank and for some reason none of the bullets register, a huge problem especially for snipers -unbalanced weapons also no point in buying skins since enemies all look the same.",0
good game worth of buy fun game,1
"this is a great stealth game. it reminds me of the series metal gear solid. the alert tone, the guards vision, sounds, and the cardboard box. i really like how the swordplay, stealth, and combat is implemented into a sidescroller like this. i definitely recommend this game to stealth lovers. you wont regret your purchase.",1

"spoilers ahead probably.. let me start this off by saying i started this off without seeing a trailer, hadn't heard about it. nothing known about this game except a snipett of a few reviews and the game description. this game wrecked me. for about an hour after playing this game i felt empty inside, i still feel weird about playing it and the story. i enjoyed every damn minute of this game, the story starts off real slow but at the end you want more, you want to know about cona and the narrator. you need to know more..if there's a resolution to the story, there isn't one yet? and there's only online threads of what people think this story actually is. do not look at trailers or anything else before playing this and when you're done search for cona on bing or google and check out the theories, it'll make you appreciate and understand this game more. i'd buy this game again and again. out of .",1

"edit steam reviewed my request and refunded the game at least to steam wallet, which is ok with me . i'm not sure if i would recommend the game as i still haven't played it, but i'm glad to see that steam do review refund requests and grant them if reasonable. original this is more a review of steam's refund policy than the game, because i was completely unable to play it. it stuck indefinitely on the title screen while eating system resources until it crashed my system. all the while racking up 'playtime' hours, which apparently count before the game even begins. steam refused to refund because of the 'long playtime', even though it's obvious i can't have played as i didn't even get the first achievement. maybe someday i will be able to play. for now, this was an expensive dud that steam refuse to refund.",0

ok so what do i have to say geometry dash it has game play it has good graphics and it is very colorful and good soundtrack now i also have been reading the steam community and there has been posts about that this game is better then the impossible game is better that is not true at all thay are both good games it is just that this game have more to it then the the impossible game game and besides the point the impossible game was st it come before this game but thay are both games and if it lags on your pc you need to get money and go out and buy a better pc there is nothing wrong with any of the games thay both have game play and good soundtrack so if you have the time and money i would recommend you get both games and add them to your steam account or ios and that is where i st seen it was on the ios,1

awesome game! best total war so far!,1
"do not buy this game has a really great concept and i like the game itself, but frankly this game wasnt, and still isnt, ready for release. pros -fun gameplay -lots of progression -fair amount of content with the asylum dlc -mild amounts of horror. cons -bad matchmaking its buggy and you are constantly requeing -doesn't reward being a team player enough one of the trailers talks about giving rewards to team players, but it's not enough for everyone to do it. -buggy gameplay the gameplay itself is full of bugs, and you'll find yourself wondering how the killer lagged over to you. -server issues i have some pretty good internet, but so often i am kicked out of the game and it's something that they havent adressed yet. if you are looking to buy this game, my suggestion would be to wait. dont buy until they have fixed these problems. i will update this review, if they fix these bugs problems.",0

"i actually didn't mind this game, but downvoting to balance out the score a bit. strata is one of these games that is 'ok' - easy to be content with, but difficult to love. the premise of the game is to select 'ribbons' in a certain order to fill out a grid with the correct colours. the design is minimalistic and rather soothing. the game is actually pretty fun at first, but has serious scaling issues. the problem is that every puzzle has the same solution - i don't mean that the ribbon combination is the same, but the thought process to solve each puzzle is identical. once you pin down the logic to solve a x grid, you just do the same thing with a x or x . with puzzle games i like to occasionally feel that i am very close to solving a problem, or that i am just missing a small piece to complete it successfully - strata will never give you that feeling, that's why it is only mediocre to me. out of",0

it's a pretty fun game for a while but then it loses its fun because it is just a little too basic for my liking and you have no control over which citizens in the game go where.,1
i have no idea why i bought this game.,0
i feel like i've played enough to finally give a review on the game. i am absolutely hooked on this game. might possibly be my favortie rpg of all time. i love everything about it. it's so amazing to look at. i often find myself stopping to soak everything in. probably one of the few games that made me want to take a screenshot of everything. i can say this game definitely is the game that makes me want to justify spending lots of money on a new videocard and a k tv. because watching this game in gorgeous k is simply a marvel to experience. it makes me glad to be a pc gamer in this day and age and i'm consdiering naming my next pet roach.,1
most amazing stand-alone mod ever. recomend it to everyone!,1
"don't get me wrong this game is amazing. aparently. i bought the game recently and have been having troubles getting the sound to work, i refuse to play the game untill i can get the sound to work, the music is amazing and i have been listening to it non-stop for a few days. before you ask yes i have looked at the incredibly vague twitter picture toby posted and it didn't help at all, i don't have any non alphabetical letters in my path to the undertale folder. i have tried re-installing the game over times by now and have tried many many many methods to get it to work, it might be that windows . is tting me but i feel like it should work anyways. i won't reccommend this game until this incredibly simple fix is actually fixed, if it is fixed holy i will play this game. edit this is about a year late but i got the game's sound to work. installing windows seemed to fix any issues i had. throughly reccommend the game. if you have had this issue before, i suggest getting a new os lol.",1
perfect aryan simulator out of would make super aryan kraken family again,1
not my cup of tea but the game has its own unique vibe,0
"to the moon is a story driven game built on the rpg maker engine. as a result, its graphics are charming yet simple, and there is little to no gameplay to be found. it is akin to a visual novel, but does not pertain to the same structure. to the moon has an astoundingly good story. you play as two doctors who implant memories into dying patients, granting their final wish to become a reality in their heads. its an interesting concept, and presents itself to unique situations. the story goes backwards in time, with the two doctors reaching deeper into his memory to eventually change it. the story of the patient, john, is heart warming and excellently told. the soundtrack is excellent as well - the piano pieces convey so much emotion, and all of it ties together to give the game an excellent feeling. i cannot recommend this enough. what it lacks in gameplay is made up for with its excellent story, and i look forward to future releases.",1
"love the game, plus neps for life.. p",1
"fun to play but way too many game break issues. campaign is ok but i did not enjoy it like the last games. wait awhile for a sale or wait til the next game. this game is worth a skip until the issues are fixed. update -- game is still badly broken. they added fov support finally but the game still run terrible no matter what you do. so many things are badly balanced, it's just not fun to play anymore. i still do not recommend this game.",0
"game restart on each catergory multiplayer, campaigne, snapmap . really crap feature. co-op is not co-op in the slightest .. massive cop out from dev's. slow response. very dissapointing, bring back proper co-op!!",0
"ugh. i really want to give this a yes, but i found the story to be overwrought - particularly the supernatural ending . this was a big miss for me. if you like point-n-clicky adventure games, i wouldn't fault you for giving this a try. maybe you'll like the story better than i.",0
this game is basically 'smash those buttons and hope for the best' type of game but still fun to play. the soundtrack in the main menu the best!! it also has a little 'create your own office' type of gamemode which is really great of your into planning an interior with your imagination. overall out of,1
i don't recomment this game to be purchased from steam.,0

"just..ugh..i can't even begin to explain whats wrong with this game if you can call it that . yes, it does have its good points, but the bad tanks everything. i dont even want to go into details about the bad. i've not the energy.",0
the ing mouse inputs don't register. how are you supposed to play,0
you little dirty i bet u wanna play this game.. play with this maybe?? but this game is a grindfest and u best be grindin on me,1
cool. the game works now after years. shame on you wb. never again.,0
paid .. i grieve for the one beer i could have had instead. obvious that your shipload of 'marines' was really just the short bus for another helmet-wearing group. i gave up because one of them kept running up to hug the xenomorphs and standing between my bullets and his new best friends. that and how many of them end up as incubators makes you wonder if they signed on with greenpeace before shipping out. ever try hitting buttons to skip being forcefed a non-interactive dialogue? get rewarded with a bullet through your head and start it over. pretty sure theres a metaphor there.,0
i love this game. it is fun.,1
if you dont make a dwarf and you do not mate with lilly. you are doing it wrong. also dont kill the only healer in the game at the mage tower. she has the big guns.,1
"aoe is a great game and like many others i was ready for this game when it landed and excited to play against others in multiplayer. they have not improved the lobby system or multiplayer system what-so-ever and it's atrocious. getting a game to start will most likely never happen, and their 'ranking' system of placing a number next to your name that other players can see is the dumbest concept ever executed in matchmaking. if you're expecting to play this game with other people easier than the original aoe or think it's anything like starcraft or csgo matchmaking you are entirely wrong. if your goal is to spend some time playing actual games of aoe instead of waiting in lobbies, you're out of luck, sorry.",0
"this game makes me despair for free play games. i don't bother playing another minute, if you want to play this which i did you will when playing on servers be constantly kicked for 'suspected cheating.' when you don't even have a single line of code for a hack! and from what i hear it is highly pay win, but don't trust me saying it's pay win because i aint playing another single millisecond of this piece of junk.",0
"a excellent game, only marred by an extremely hostile playerbase. i would recommend only playing with friends or finding a community that will welcome new players to the franchise, as a good number of players on here are extremely childish, and will harass kick new players out with extreme prejudice.",1
out of this game sucks do not buy it you will regret it,0
it doesn't matter how good the implementation is - no multiplayer for a board game means it's not worth buying.,0
"this campaign is completely broken. otherwise, i was loving this game. too bad. sad that i didn't notice the problems til hrs in. discussion about it here",0
this game is a beautiful game. out of recommended.,1
"obsidian's underrated espionage rpg, alpha protocol has amazing malleability and replayability as far as how you shape the story with your mission choices and the way you treat others. the open nature of choosing your missions can cause you to meet allies who will help you in later missions.. or remember what you did to them the next time you meet, so be cautious you may even miss a couple of characters entirely depending on where your travels take you! the game also has an incredible dialog system, where people will come to know you by your actions and expect you to act a certain way - you can prove them right, or throw them off - something that can come to your advantage played carefully. enemy or ally, both can work to your favor. also interesting is the ability to choose a background that further affects conversations and gives your extra points in different categories. choose rookie first! while the gameplay is your standard tps rpg hybrid, this game is a must have for anyone that enjoys games with top tier dialog and freedom of character development such as vampire the masquerade bloodlines or fallout new vegas.",1
"has potential to be one of the best games out there but the developers focus too much on money-grabbing dlc than fixing the many, many bugs in the game.",0
"the neptunia franchise is not for everyone, but if you enjoyed rebirth and you will definitly love this. the amount of references and broken fourth walls in this game are off the charts compared to the last two in the series. i love it.",1

"would not run. followed all the forum tutorials, but no luck. refunded. looks like a brilliant game though. steam should figure out what is going on with this as it seems like i am far from alone in encountering this issue. can not reccomend a purchase right in the current state i am afraid.",0
amazing game endles fun when the game is over u feel like u wana cry becuse its so good best game ive played,1
"the game is a complete lie and everyone who bought it got scammed, plain and simple. completely disappointed in this game entirely. its nothing how the trailers showed and it has less content than minecraft. the game is you mindlessly traveling the same planets just a different retexture, collecting the same elements just so you can travel more. there is no civilization to find just little trading huts, the story is a complete piece of crap. you can't create building or stuctures all you do is collect sell, fly around and travel to another planet lt -- which is the same planet just a diferent color.",0
"a 'click stuff to gain stuff to buy stuff that helps you click even more stuff'-kind of game with lots and lots of anime chicks with less-than-appropriate, mix-matched appearances. the game rewards you for multiple game sessions. however, it's a shame that the repetition is best done at lower levels buying rebirth everytime that you can thus lowering the incentive for progression. i just couldn't catch'em all. highly recommended for a computer too compitent for a visual novel but not enough to run d anime girl simulators smoothly.",1
"i like the graphics i like the sounds i like lots of performance tweaks i like lots of camera, field of view tweaks i like there are ui hud tweaks i like driving on nurburgring with a pagani best driving exp you'll get dont try in real life! i dislike the handling, with a dualshock is almost impossible to handle these cars, guess i need an steering wheel, but i'm almost certain i'll sck anyway in this game. i dislike low framrate on my system guess it needs an upgrade for such demanding title with cars on screen is a lot!! time trial mode is ok though i can hit fps with a few gfx tweaks here and there . it's a demo for vive and oculus or w o vr headsets it's free. why no try it?",0
i expect nothing and still get let down,0
"if this game was still being developed i would pay for it, but as is i would say free is the right price.",1
this game is such a huge disappointment.,0

"a fun little nostalgia trip to arcade days gone by. story is entertaining. i'd call it amusing more than outright funny, but as a whole, i enjoyed it. short and sweet. if you're expecting a long game, don't come here.",1

"if you guys thinking do gta san andreas or saints row iv forget about that, go with better things and you should try this cool game, it has everything it includes helicopters,planes,enemies,sexy es and lets not forget bad missions.",1
"this game is horrible for anyone who is slightly ocd like myself and an avid fan of history. this is due to the city name generation when you build a city no where near its living counterpart. if the game ever makes me build paris off the seine again i will scream. however i know that this will never happen as i fully intend on never playing it again. like so many reviewers like myself, this game had so much potential but turned out to be our pc master race worst enemy.. ..a casual game.",0
"huh, is this even a game, really? i got this for free and i regret wasting my time.",0
"the pinnacle of 'one more turn' games. design a god. build a fantasy empire. conquer the world. you're able to play a race of hardy mountain dwarves, able to create sturdy arms and armour, using powerfull fighters, worshiping a magic rock. or perhaps try an army of undead monsters using rituals of death to enslave the living, lead by an undead wizard.",1
i did not like the game at all. i could not get on it. it was saying seculauncher failed to start application,0
"so much more fun that it appears to be at first glance. is it worth ? up to you to decide but i was willing to pay. great for when you just want to pick up and play something for minutes without having to invest any real energy in a game. there is more depth to the game, all pun intended, if you want it. but mostly i just play a couple minutes at a time when i'm bored and want to get eaten by sharks.",1
"i can only think of things i didn't love about this game. the first one is that i want to enjoy it even more as it was really really well created. the second is that some of the puzzles were a bit too easy for me as puzzles is something i'm very good at. i strongly recommend this game for everyone that's even slightly interested in puzzles and math and 'logic'-based problems. the overall feeling is amazing, the graphics, the music, the sound and effects. buy it!",1
"pros probably one of the most creative and original stories i'e ever experienced in a horror game similar controls to other frictional games and does the job nicely environment is easily on par with rapture when it comes to immersing you in the world very atmospheric and creepy with virtually no jump scares graphically it is a very pretty game unlike most games the ending feels satisfying although i've seen a couple of people complain about the voice acting, i thought it was good cons only one con for me and that was the optimisation, the game tends to stutter every now and then and i couldn't for the life of me sort it out. i am above the recomended specs and it should run no problem but something just wasn't working correctly for me. this didn't stop me enjoying the game though and i'd say it was well worth buying.",1

"to the moon is one of those games you instantly fall in love with. with it's simple, but elegant design, incredible writing, and thrilling, heartfelt tale, to the moon is more story than game, but what a story it is.",1
"an excelent open-ended game to pass a lot of time. although i think it could do with a few more features and possibly a little more detail in the way of a tutorial i am quite pleased to play this game. offering unlimited design possibilities, the only limit is your time and imagination. different factions offer different tools and weapons, as well as entire ship-structuring features. the open-ended gameplay means that once you've got a ship that works, you can make other ships that make more ships. build stations to protect areas of space you have cleared and hunt down other players' designs that are loaded into your world throguh wormholes and allow you to send your ships off as ai enemies to terrorise other players in their games i strongly recomend this game, but because of a few gameplay features i feel are vitally missing, i would recomend waiting for a sale",1
"this game could be fun, but the ui makes it barely playable. hopefully this will be better after some patches. wouldn't recomment buying it now though.",0
its great fun bit hard but still great,1
"not impressed. compared to all of the other assassin's creed games it's boring. the bugs are plenty too. tried to get my horse to cross a stream, would call it a puddle really but he just wouldn't cross. poor nelly the horse. he never got to the other side.",0
wtf why dont you fix the .. launcher problem asss,0
"it's great, just buy it and enjoy. one thing not so great is that the game reminds you that 'someone will remember this', while i dont think that really does any difference on the plot. it's not like that mass effect thing where your speech means life and death for your teammates.",1
"let me be clear even though i don't agree with the dlc overload i could honeslty care less. i enjoy the game and it is great in many aspects. but there is one huge problem we have here. dev support for this game is absolute poop. i have seen indie games that get treated better than this. as much money as they have to be making i cannot help but be disappointed in turtle rock. loved left dead, but valve were always on top of things when it came to fixing with that game. turtle rock apparently thinks they don't have to be i guess.",0
"interesting concept but very poorly executed. i get that some games prioritize telling a story over having enjoyable gameplay, but cibele basically has none. the gameplay itself is just incredibly boring, and doesn't offer the player any substance. all it consists of is playing a fictional game where you click on enemies, and nothing more. it is excruciatingly boring. this game should have just been created in the form of a short video. the story itself is told via voice-overs and files on the player's computer. at first i thought the story would be somewhat interesting, but it is told in a terribly cringey way, which made it impossible to relate to the player character. having the main character say 'i always do my best to look anime ', and yes that is a literal quote, is the easiest way i've ever seen to drive people away from a game. not only is the method of storytelling executed quite poorly, but the story in itself is nothing to write home about. i found myself completely unable to care for the relationship between this nina and her internet boyfriend.",0
this is the best way to play one of the best adventure games ever made.,1
"the game itself is amazing, but don't even think about trying to run it on pc. this game took me forever to get running, after countless x live less downloads and modifications to shortcuts but none of them worked. social club is the reason for this in that you have to log in to play online, you click play offline and it asks you to log in, not so bad, but social club shut down.. when you get it to run, the game is locked at and you have to change properties to get it to run right, then it keeps freezing and crashing for me. pirating the game seems the only option for me to play this game. get it if you want, but if you do, you're in for a headache or two trying to run this game properly.",0
"do not buy if you like rome total war. this is a dumbed down, streamlined version, that's quite honetsly, pathetic. the dlc train has left the station and is at full speed. this game was rushed and is extremely un-optimized, has practically none of the cool features of previous total war games, stupid and pointless 'inter-faction' politcs, falsely advertised siege battles, absolutely terrible ai, and was streamlined, cutdown, dumbed down, packaged up and made retar ded because it's being released on steams console. this game was designed to be used with a controller. yup. you can't custom select amounts for bribes or payments, can't demand give territory, the list goes on. it's really bad. i tried to like it. i love total war games, look at my play time. this is..something else.",0
not recommended! graphics and bugs everywere.. expecially graphic bugs..,0
"i gotta say this one of the best racing arcade style ish out in this wonderful world, you can change all in this game and easy to make your own cars if you look around the net they got plenty of help for beginners. hell even the all the forums and community got helpful chaps. out of in my opinion. ps sorry for bad english, it aint my native language.",1
why write a review describe my first impression when i can do a video? youtube video nbsp,1
"not sure how this game has postitive unless they're buying or farming reviews. maybe i couldn't get past the initial boring bit, but given the way it was playing out, i doubt it. the dialogue is long winded to the point of agonizing. you don't need to be told it's a wasteland five times when you can walk around and see that it's a wasteland. you don't need to be told you live in a when you can look around and see that it's a . the storytelling is obvious, lazy, and cumbersome. game play is clunky. the dialogue system forces you to read a selection, then when you click to ask the question, your character asks the thing you just read again. i thought i'd made it out of some initial chunk of frontloaded exposition when i wound up in a forced dialogue with some trailer . couldn't stand it. i quit. i'm going to try out steam's new return option asap.",0
kidn of now . .,0
"great if you like portal-type games. you control dimensions heavy, fluffy, time speed, and reverse gravity. john delancie q from star trek narrates, so that's a definite plus, and just enough of a story to keep you interested though just about as much as the first portal .",1
out of the plot was amazing even as i skipped every bit of text i knew exactly what was going on out of,1
this is an awesome game aside from the freezes the game periodically does.,1
"very interesting platformer. this is one of those games that doesn't really tell you what is going on, so you have to kinda figure it out on your own, and i love that! nice calm soundtrack that makes you relaxed, while the game makes you think. just to sum it up, i thought it was a short and sweet game! and its free as well! d",1
"i've just played one sitting, and can already tell it's great. i have thoroughly enjoyed each of the previous treasures of montezuma titles on my ipod and ipad , and will definitely buy this again if it launches on mobile in the future. they keep the game as simple as the first one, and spice it up with new modes, improved graphics, and a story this time as well!",1
"i don't recomment this if you are looking to play 'actual' co op. this game only offer co-op in raid mode and not story mode. i first bought this to play story with boyfriend, then i found out. i ended up playing this solo with a stupid ai that don't exactly do anything..",0
"don't get me wrong, it's a great arcade shooter. the crashes though have to do with the mode of windows you run it on. i have windows , and it crashes with steam still saying i'm playing it. the only thing that is worse than the crashes is the disc gun.",0
"though it had been greetly improved over the years, i just can't recommand that game and the dlc's. the only thing that save it are the modders who add tons of units and things. because yes, without any mod, every nations have quite the same units. and you won't have that much choice as there is not enough units in each nations. also, i've been very disappointed with the maps. seriously, every maps look like the same and all of them are just empty. oh yeah, sometimes you'll have some trees. nothing else. i don't recommand that game, shogun is a lot more better than this one. or, just wait for the next total war. i hope my comment helped !",0
this game is offensive to watermellons.. still out of,1
one of the most unique of its genre. one of the example where ubisoft didn't screwed up their games. this game was just awesome.,1
"easy to learn, hard to master and addicting as f . even tho it might seem a bit simple and repetitve in the beginning, you can spend hour after hour trying to get better and climb devisions in competitve. controller and friends to play with recommended.",1
"so far its really good. extremely good graphics. this does cause some framerate issues even with top-end computers during scene changeovers switching to battle-cam. will probably be ironed out with patches, but its not bad enough to hurt the gameplay. the customizing of the team is still there and the music design scene when you send your boys and girls out to the field just makes every mission feel epic and special. no more sats. thank you. makes x-com enemy unkown feel like an alpha version despite it being a great game imo. the quality is just that high. also mod support!!",1
"assassin's creed is fun, engaging and entertaining. the characters and there voice actors are briliant and the enviroments are emersive. the story pulls you right in and makes you want to know what happens next. the only caveat i have is the camara angles and control response is a little rough sometimes. overall however i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an open world adventure with a great story you wont be sorry you picked it up.",1
still better but still works unlike dark souls which is ing buggy as hell,1
originally when i first started playing the game i thought it was one of the best of its kinds but now that i have been playing for a while i get fatal errors constantly making the game unplayable. this is not to be expected from a high end gaming pc.,0

i really like this game. it's clean simple fun that any fan of space science fiction and strategy will most likely enjoy.,1
"theres always some kind of charm to these types of indie games, and this is one of those. this game is simple, unique and calming ish with no killing or violence. in other words, i would recommend this. however, i think the price is slightly higher than it should be, not sure.",1
"ill keep my report short. if you once owned fable, and youd like to own it once more, this version of it is a nice makeover. however, if you currently own fable, it isnt worth a cent. i bought this game on sale, and i still wish i hadnt bought it. shoulda listened to the reviews, but i was stubborn. pros the new look of the enviroments.. thats about it.. the trees are pretty.. cons character models are hideous. whoever put them together clearly did this as a rush job. new menus are far more clunky. sorry i cant use a better word to describe. this is a game that was only put out as an 'hd' anniversary edition as a means to make money. i dont even blame the company for that. i mean, thats what companys do. i only mention this as a warning to all there was no heart put into this. none. the only good thing they did was add the ability to modify the game. perhaps with that feature, someone will give this game a real makeover. once again you have failed us. i am the fool for trusting you, and this is my confession.",0

"fun casual space shooter. d plane of movement lots of ways to progress piracy, trading, mercenary work, missions, exploring for junkfields. really fun to play. a bit disapointing if you want to follow a great story, it just ends via a dialogue choice like in the first few steps of the game. other than that it's good. hours to get to the last tier ships op as hell",1
this game is really great it has good graphics and the gameplay makes you addicted. i must say it i quite boring the first hour but when you get more machines you will get the hang of it. this is worth the money if you have a patiance,1

rather dull. at least it is free.,0
"i'll get the bad out of the way first. in some ways the remaster still lacks polish, some messy scenes, the controls are still weird and clunky, and the entire plot will probably give you a headache at first consideration. some of the ui is messy and confusing after jumping from menu screen to menu screen. all this said the silver case lives up to being a classic suda game in every respect. the writing once you wrap your mind around it is brilliant. it jumps from ham fisted to ethereal and mysterious. the translation while kind of tacky sometimes captures in this the sort of translation you'd expect in making the whole game feel like a dive into a time capsule. the silver case is a heady postmodern masterwork that has all the quirks and loveable motifs from any grasshopper manufacture game. it is a rare slice of history kept true to source in an era where games preservation is fighting uphill. if you like off kilter visual novels or adventure games this is worth the trip.",1

"this game is just straight unfair. never able to hit shots that are at or under, enemies rarely miss even if i am behind full cover , hours in and it has been the first time a viper has missed to grab me, is the panic percentage for my team at when someone dies or gets wounded ? , and constant stress and worrying about when the next block of proggress for the enemy to end your game will randomly come up. the cinematic scenes were nice, really enjoyed the story, some aliens looked nice some made me ask why is this a thing , and gameplay is good at times. i seriously thought i was going to love this game and at first i did, then i started to see how unfair it was. don't buy this if you want to have fun.",0
"i spent the almost entirity of my time playing this game dealing with an extremely annnoying texture glitch that i couldn't find any help for anywhere. finally after about hours i gave up and deciced ok even though my game has all the foliage mixed and blended together so i can't see where any of the supposed drop caches are supposed to be. i'll try to ignore it and just play. then i spent the next minutes dying over and over from the flying dinosaurs on the map. there was no way to counteract them i couldn't hide, run, on fight them off becasue i couldn't find any weapons due to the strange foliage problem. i doubt i would have been able to kill them if i even wasn't dealiing with my strange glitch as what these enemies do is pick you up, fly you way up in the sky, and drop you for a one hit kill. the game overall feels very unfinsihed and should not have been released in this state. i really wish i had not bought it and as long as it is in this state no one should.",0
"expected a terraria clone, i dont even know what this is.",0

very recommended game you wont regret buying with your friends or even alone. i even bought trine because this was so awesome and i feel like trine could be even better out of,1
"-why motion capture is gone ? -why all races aren't include ? coming in expensive dlc i presume -why ai don't care about upkeep ? -why can't we customize our army's outfits's colours ? i mean, we do paint warhammer figures -where is the light effect during battle ? there is no light, everything is dark -where are battle speeches we had in shogun ? and more others questions i understand that modders can complete the game but this is not a reason to let them do all the dirty work. sitll i recommend this game because i love tw franchise, and i believe they will improve this game, and the others coming in the future. i am having fun playing this game, but i feel deeply disapointed.",1
i recommend this game for all of those people around the world that just want a fun game. its fun and to me never really gets old. iv been playing serious sam games all my life since i was years old and have not been disapointed with one of them. love how the game machanics work and how the gameplay feels. the only down side to this game was the lack of distructibility in the multi player versus modes and how small the maps were. however the game is still my favourite game of all time!,1
"this is one of those reviews where its not a 'yes no' situation. its a decent game, with some serious balance issues, and since its 'free to play! tm' its not like i can say not to try it. that said, the game is a hot mess right now. where the balance isn't killing it, the grinding through the tech tree is. i wouldn't suggest spending any money on it until the devs get themselves sorted out, and that doesn't look to be likely anytime soon.",0
an amazing game! i really love this game because its a new experience every time i play with so many factions to choose from!!,1
great game old but still fun,1
"wait for all the episodes to be released, then it'd probably be worth it.",0
beautiful graphics. terrificantly fun so far. very easy to mod. ai diplomacy needs improvement.,1
"very disappointed in the game. the humour is not enough to make the game enjoyable all the way to the end. in fact, some of the ways they try to inject humour into the game are inconceived and just torturous. at one point in the game, they try to draw redicule to how rediculous, unnecessary and unjoyable fetch quests are by giving you two fetch quests. in the end though, you are still doing frick'in fetch quests. that's like explaining to your friend that doing crystal meth isn't good, by doing crystal meth yourself and showing him disastrous results. some of the 'dlc' aren't humourous but just plain annoying. there's one called an 'hd next gen' pack which makes the screen such a wanktastic colour you can barely see where you're going and makes your eyes bleed. this is not fun.",0
"its not for me, its too frustrating",0
"don't buy this game, it doesn't work, most laptop users can't get past the loading screen crash and those few who can play are plagued by game breaking bugs and crashes, it seems pirated versions somehow work better. also crapcom lacks communication and only comes with workarounds that don't work for most people instead of providing a fix. it seems that beta testing is something new to capcom..",0

"doom gets closer to original doom game play than doom ever did. basically, you run around with a lot of weapons and slaughter a lot of demons. the upgrades and power ups are a nice touch. let's not forget the classic secret hunting action either. the only real con i have is that the game does get a bit repetetive at times. basically, you walk for a bit, get to an area that is sealed off, fight a certain number of demons, and repeat. this can get tiring after a while. also, the challange system can get annoying too. you complete a challange to earn an upgrade, then must complete another challenge actually be able to use it.",1

"it's fun but it doesn't want you running in ultrawide if you have an ultrawide monitor. you can get around with your gpu settings and stuff but otherwise there's no option, and it normally doesn't last with the outside settings.",1
"now contrary to what i said this game is awsome, i love it like it where one of my kids. the reason i down voted it is cause of the community. it whent to hell in a hand basket in a few months. if your getting the game for single player go ahead but if your interested in playing multiplayer skip this one. this community is full of clan s who spam and troll who do nothing but blow there own horn. love you mount n blade, but i hate your community more.",0

"mostly interesting small and multi-room puzzles, a few with obtuse elements. some situations seemed like there were object-grabbing or traversal options that might be a way out, but weren t interactable. would have liked an option to widen move the view in some areas. encountered a handful of gotcha moments. favorite elements were working with the automatons, and luring dangerous creatures around. exploration a little hampered by slow movement and looming death from drops or drowning. great atmosphere. unspeakably strange ending.",1

this game.. seriously not worth it. just tons of doing grunt work.. everything progresses so slowly.. just no.,0
"i first wrote this review as a positive review, but i've now changed my mind. it's a great warhammer game, but for being a total war game it feels like something is missing. i still think the base game itself is worth the money even though it's missing a lot of free razes, it's still pretty okay. then i saw then cost of the call of the beastmen dlc, which cost is outrageous. the dlc costs , too be able to play a raze that should already be free. i really wish i could enjoy this game but sega has just ruined it for me!",0
game has a very short mission timer. so if you liked building your castle with patience before attacking forget about this game.,0
i take a break and the game goes to hell. wish i could have played it more. ost's nice tho.,0
this game is absolutely amaizing the first time i got this game i was in love and still am graphics out of money out of what isnt out of tell me ?,1
new genre sonba singleplayer online noone to battle with arena lower the price - or even make it f p because this game could be great.,1
this game is by far the worst i have ever played it does not give good instruction on missions and when it show what button to press it gets froze in a loop never allowing it to work i wasted my money so dont waste yours,0
this game was released over years ago and i still encounter bugs that cause the game to hang. it will freeze on the ai's turn and i am forced kill the game's process.,0
it would be nice if you could use previous scripts from older versions of rpg maker without having to convert the ruby script to java script. the software needs a script editor outside of playing the test run inside the main window like the previous versions. this program also needs layers to help visualize the world you are creating. if this could be added it would be nice and it would help others to create new stories in a simple coding way.,0
this game mutated into a cesspoll of toxicity. don't touch it with a ten-foot pole.,0
"the game itself is amazing, a fantastic adventure game. however, i'd recommend getting the hd version on consoles, the pc version has numerous graphical bugs.",1

"well that was a fun ride. for those who enjoy turn-based rpg, then this is the game for you. this game comes complete with - hilarious characters - awesome skills, spells, and summons - tons of equipments for a variety of combinations to use in battle - awesome soundtrack by hfx - new game for even more replay value i've been keeping track of the ebf series since the second game. and i still haven't beaten them on epic and it makes me happy as a fan to see how each new game improves compared to the previous game. this game was made by an awesome guy who has been making awesome free games. buying this game would help out a ton for matt for all his hard work. even if you can't buy it, then you can play the free version on kongregate, along with every other games he has made. the experience is still the same, no matter what version of ebf you play.",1
"this game is absolutely fantastic. it's singleplayer will challenge anyone who isn't already a pro to the total war franchise. i found it to be great fun, and if you have a friend to play with, it's even better. i personally wouldn't reccomend this over any other total war game, as medieval ii is much more worth the buy. if you're more specifically looking for a roman total war game, it'd be better to buy atilla or rome ii if your pc can handle it.",1
my only regret is not being able to get a refund.,0
very like agar.io i love it!,1
bugged piece of garbage. why the hell was this released in such an appalling state. i have tried to play single player games and it has crashed within minutes on both attempts. this should be removed from steam until it is stable enough to play. what a waste of money. edit tried one more game. blue donut then game crashes to desktop. mins this time. how do i get a refund?,0

"nothing but a big mod for civilization v. lacks new innovation, sluggish and boring gameplay. makes you appreciate the original civ games much more. pros - alien ai's present a better challenge than barbarians had - basics for the game are easy to learn if you've played the other civ games - quests present a fun way to extend benefits for your basic buildings and tiles cons - ai civs have no personality and quotes are exactly the same as civ v - no innovation in new gameplay, techs, buildings, and units - units can only be upgraded after you've reached a certain level, and only one class at a time, making your units stale for long periods of time - health happiness is very hard to gain, there are no luxuries but about more resources for building - aliens are the biggest threat, it's hard to explore water or land without dying in on hit - tech system is horrible, that's all there is to it",0

"i downloaded this game last friday cause me and my dad used to play it when i was little. let me tell you, it has gone way down hill. now, i do not cuss very often, nor do i ever use racial slurs. and i have been banned from about of my favorite servers already. why? cause friendly fire is on, and people will jump in front of you, and you team kill, and then you get banned. or, your on the mic, and say, 'oh my god', and get kicked for using religious slurs. and no, it doesn't depend on the server. cause one of my favorite servers, nicknamed the 'blitzreig wh res', banned me for team killing in a close quarters hallway with a support class. i got banned from my most favorite server because i don't know. this guy literally said, 'that's not tolerated' and banned me. this game used to be so fun, and everyone just had a blast. now its an uptight, strict, clan run, admin abusing embarrassment. don't waste your ten dollars. unless you want the wwii expirience so bad your willing to sacrafice your own fun.",0

"tldr avoid it. fans of the franchise, wait for it to go on sale for under . it's story isn't any better or worse than what we've read in other extended universe alien media. my play through was fun only because i did co-op with a friend and the situations we got ourselves into were often times funny. fans of aliens will want to stop and look around to see things from the movie and listen to the audio logs. it seems like an immense amount of effort went into making hadley's hope movie accurate. and impressively enough, it certainly was. at the cost of neglecting everything else about the game. the game is dated in just about every way. and you really notice it immediately and often. also, hicks is in this game. and the explanation for why he isn't dead is rather silly. there doesn't even seem to be a significant reason for him to be alive other than as fan service.",0
"what a total waste of time, the buggyes game i have ever played. even notorious alpha games are far less buggy than this final relese. the devs seem to not give a about their players experiance. there is no way to play online with your friends. i would expect this level of issues from a game set in alpha but as a final relese poor show",0

"i do not recommend getting this port. i bought it when i upgraded my system to a -core amd fx at . ghz, gb of ram, and an nvidia geforce . this game runs like trash. don't let the cinematic framerate throw you off, because as soon as the actual game begins, you will not get a consistent framerate, and i've had maybe fps at best. the original xiii runs the smoothest out of the three titles, with xiii- being a runner-up. i do not see square enix releasing any sort of patch or fix to the game to fix the poor porting, so i recommend spending your . elsewhere.",0

"firstly, this game is perfectly acceptable in some ways. i like pve shootery stuff. i like the fantasy feels with the modern military theme. works fine. making people unable to play medics or engineers out of the gate is dumb. you know what? classes should be playable. no one is allowed to get rezzed because no one has medic unlocked is just a bad plan. the mouse's aim speed literally changes at random at all times. i cannot hit anything because it decides it's going to go way faster or way slower basically at the drop of a hat. this game has hard-locked, memory-dump-and-bluescreened my win . machine twice in only an hour's playtime. i uninstalled this already. the technical problems are too great seriously, randomly changing mouse sensitivity? , and with crytek employees not going to work and not getting paid, i have no confidence that this will get out of beta.",0
this game is good for the first minutes and once you have everything built its trash. there is nothing to do expanding just gets everyone killed. there are no things to fight or worry about really. the system of trade is hard to deal with and the people who are in the city have horrible ways to get to where they need to go. leading them to get killed. i dont recommend to play this if you want to waste money.,0
a good game if you like strategic game play.,1
best game yet i really enjoy the game,1
"its not terrible. the game itself is fun, but it is kind of a waste in a way also. given the size of the map and extremely small amount of visible players allowed, it feels pretty much dead. it claims it is a living game, but in reality it isn't. there is nothing innovative about this game. basically it is a prettied up version of nfsw with less visible players and a better map. it is always online, so if they decide to shut down servers, you won't even be able to play it. other players in the game seem to keep to themselves, have yet to find a pvp match or co-op in time played and i queue for it fairly often. i bought this game on sale and still feel kind of ripped off. i'd give it a thumbs up if it was in the under section, but its not.",0

"pre-advanced edition i would still recommend it highly. post-advanced edition i would have still bought it again! this roguelike game is as much infuriating as it is addictive. and that's no bad thing! the soundtrack is stellar, the story and sub-quests are random but satisfying to complete, and the magnitude of ships and weaponry are fantastic.",1
"highly recommended! straiht up old-school action in a politically incorrect narrative. we need more like this. no cut scenes, all the story is at the beginning and the end, nothing distracts from the action. the structure of the game allows you to play for - if that's all you have or you can play for hours.",1

im so disapointed in this total war it has moved me to write only my second review of a game on steam. this is by far the worst total war to date yes rome was broke on release but now its quite good now and has far more content than this espeally with mods from the workshop. im not going to speak of the middle finger dlc policy they are taking with this game it makes me nsw. most major reviews i have seen for this game claim its awesome which is utter lies. this game is a rip off and sega and ca know it they are preying on total war fans and warhammer fans alike to milk you of your cash. one last parting comment for ca dont bother making a full lenght title any more just release a base platform and let modders like radious do the rest as they have done they job for you in your last three titles.,0
"i adore this game. i was unfortunately pretty awful at the bullet-hell style battles so i finished off watching the game from other people's let's-plays on youtube. the story pulled me in from the beginning and the light-hearted humour which overshadows such a dark and tragic story is cleverly done. i found myself both laughing and crying uncontrollably at certain points of the game. my favourite aspect of this game is the soundtrack. every song on the ost stands out in one way or another and i find myself listening to them when doing seemingly normal tasks day to day. i recommend this game to anyone who loves story driven games. this game is a gem and i hope this isn't the last we see of the story. out of , love it love it love it!!",1

"a really fantastic game that reminds me a lot of battle of britian on my old commodore many years ago. i have to say though with modern computing and gaming in general this a really whole new world. the ai is crafty and can wipe you out if you can't keep up. interesting tactical map situations put you into real binds. do i need a radar? or do i place a aa gun and try to soften the german bombing groups en route and then strike? oh and there is that little thing about lacking planes. maybe i need to build a factory. it reall is quite a puzzler. also the battle map is super simplified yet very satisfying as you try your best to cause the maximum damage in a situation where you are ussually outnumbered, without losing pilots and machines. a great game that will have you suffering from missing time syndrome. if you tell yourself, okay minutes then off to the movies, you may find that minutes multiplying into hours. good stuff!",1
"what it doesn't tell you, these reviews - is that it doesn't go fullscreen. you get black bars on the side. no widescreen. which is honestly distracting. because i can play the game on my ps , on my new tv, and have it stretch to fit the screen. with no noticeable defects. if there are any options to fiddle with, i can't access them. the game doesn't recognize the keyboard, it doesn't recognize the buttons of my controller. once i'm in the game, i'm stuck. i don't find it a very good port at all. so if you're a fan of the game when it was on the ps or dreamcast, and think it'll be the same? it won't. make sure you understand that before you buy it.",0

"i'll be completing the game soon. by far, it's a great game with a fantastic atmosphere. it sets in an eerie tone even outside of the asylum. though, i can't agree with those who say it's the scariest game. there's a few jump scares but it's nothing disturbing. any chases or parts where you have to sneak past monsters and such are not scary, but merely stressful because as much as i mash my left click button, my character won't hide in the damn locker. i find the scariest games are the ones that disturb the most. you know, the ones that send shivers or make your stomach turn. that's not in this game unless you're squeamish. the pools of blood and stacks of dead bodies get rather boring after a while. i started off in this game by slowly opening doors and expecting anything to jump at me but now i'm running down the halls just trying to complete the objectives. the scare really faded from it ten minutes in. it's still a fantastic game.",1

"hello, this is my first impression of the game after almost minutes of playing. and if a game does not appeal after the first half an hour.. it isn't worth the time. pros - the only good solid thing about this title is.. the music. cons - extremely bad level design, you cannot tell what is a floor and what is a wall, also tunnels.. - most of the weapons i tried were extremely weak and with very range. - the upgrade menu is very bad put together, what the funk does a mean to repair? i am using mouse and keyboard, wtf developers.. - very overpriced game for the kind of 'fun' it offers..",0
"a slow walk down a short road. an excruciatingly slow plod through sixteen rooms that you'll have to walk through long after overstaying their welcome. i would not call this an adventure game, as those commonly have story and puzzles to go with the walking from screen to screen. in fact, i hesitate to call this a game at all because while there is a beginning and end, what occurs in the middle is a series of short animation cycles that happen around you. other than walking to the edges of the screen, the only meaningful action you can take is to open your map or advance time to the next day or night. it's really more of a short animated feature that you have to click on to move forward.",0
"not a very good start to the game. they give you an incredibly weak deck and have you fight against well made decks in the campaign. which leaves you with luck and luck only. if you don't get a good hand, you won't win. it's rather annoying, especially when all i want to do is just play multiplayer with my friends.",0

well it's a good game when you play it with friends but it's almost unplayable online with random people. and there will always be some engineers and being engineer is like the most boring thing to be and almost the most important one to be. playing as the captain is pretty fun playing as the gunner is also fun i guess. but this is more like a game that you play or times and then never play again that's why i don't like this game,0
"don't look at the metascore for this one. this is an old-school shooter with tight controls, satisfying gameplay, and a fantastic-looking environment. it's also full of crude humor and general oldschool machoness. think serious sam or duke nukem, but with a lot more melee options. the gameplay is tight, you move fast, the enemies strafe and dodge your fire. the environments are detailed and feel realistic as opposed to seriouis sam, where alleys look like football stadiums . the game is linear, but there are plenty of hidden gems and secrets to be found. it's also full of references to old school shooters. this game is gorgeous, even on low settings. but if you want higher fidelity you'd have to add a bit of heat to your graphics cards. sometimes the enemies feel a bit repetitive or even bullet-spongey. the characters are maybe a bit too macho to be likeable, the same way that bulletstorm's characters didn't really appeal to me.",1
"this game is mediocre at best and lacks feature that made the nd in the franchise pretty fun to play. i think if they would of added a shadow of mordor general type of system with mob bosses and luitenants it would of been much better. to sum it up, mafia iii is like playing an outdated mafia sequel with better eye candy. cons very repetitive, for example missions, animations, and music that makes the game feel more like a grind than enjoyable. weird lighting that makes lakes rivers glow like the sun when the sky is dark and cloudy. arcade feel all around. classic mafia gameplay that has less features than mafia ii. pros decent graphics. voice acting and facial animations are very good. colectable bewbies. the stealth system. the story so far is predictable but, still enjoyable.",0

"absolutely wonderful ! a deep, thought provoking story that is rich in well made characters that you can really grow attached to as friends! and made me cry once or twice because of this close bond you make with them! shh, don't tell! tied in with a beautiful soundtrack - i can't stop listening to the music! this is the first rpg i know of that you can progress the entire story without harming a single character and make you feel right rubbish if you do.",1
this game is . don't spend your money on this.,0
this game hangs big time when played on linux ..,0
"the most action packed and funny telltale game till now,with lovable characters.i really hope they make a season !",1
"most satisfying event of the game was when i just uninstalled the game and deleted the local files. big release of drive space, kind of like after a heavy meal. won't even think of the game anymore.. as dead to me as 'grand ages medieval'.",0
this game is broken now. i played it before had differant saves none of which would load and tried to start a new game and i can not. so basicly the game is worse off from the last time i played it seeing how i can not play it now at all. i am not recommending and i am not recommending due to this is my experience and others obvioulsy have been playing and yes my rig is more than capable it's a menu not responding issue,0
this game is horrible i want my money back,0
"love this game so much, very funny and a great puzzle game to boot!",1
this game is pretty difficult. got it on sale for .. pretty much only good for the cards.,0
for one race.. off creative assembly,0
"good little game. plenty to do amp explore with interesting stories. the talent system works well and can be adjusted to suit how you like playing the hero. especially good value while it's on special, wish they had it on when i bought it.",1
"this game is miserable. a fun physics engine for blowing up people's houses doesn't save the game from being aggressively bad as a shooter, which is what it actually is between thing-upblowals. also i once failed a mission because the npc that was driving the vehicle i was supposed to get into drove out of the mission area.",0
"good! really like the idea of different 'focus trees' for countries, which adds flavor for major nations. i truly believe the game would be a gem after several patches. had some graphics and performance issues, but they were fixed in .. beta. and ai is much less stupid since .. give it a try!",1
"this is an outstanding game. this is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, it is so better then simcity in every way out of",1
"good game, fun to play with friends.",1
"badly made mobile port. but i don't mind it. i don't care about graphics duke nukem had better looking d backgrounds years ago , don't care about bad physics its arcade after all or that there are only cars sic! . but i will not forgive one thing. this game is f boring. have you ever almost fall asleep during race? have you hit the wall and realised that after one minute because you were thinking about what to prepare for dinner? yeah - it's that boring. also i had weird controler problems. i changed buttons bindings in launch menu and ocassionally they changed themself during race. only way to change it back was to alt f and running game again.",0
crusader kings .. is a grande strategy game..,1
"gfwl. it makes this game almost impossible to play. i love the gta games, but really r , get rid of gfwl please! this has worked for some people x liveless",0
"just another clone of slender which you have to find random numbers of objects scattered around the map. nothing really interesting or new to see. the voice acting is really bad, the graphics are not impressive. i encountered a lot of game breaking bugs. it's a free game so you can always try, but don't expect much.",0
"wow, this game is shoot shoot and no poot poot",1
"wrc is frustrating to behold. it contains a great deal of content, authentic rally stages and a decent driving model, but it is let down by a shoddy execution which leaves it crashing frequently and stuttering very often. everything it does can be better enjoyed in grid or dirt .",0
"this is a fantastic game, i recommend you get this now at this price.. its a steal.",1
just awesome! hope bethesda will look up to this game.,1
"this is absolutly a great game! i love the fact that the developers are constantly updating the game and adding new features like new sharks. also the game is great graphically and i love the selection of shark species that are there for selection. this game though is a very tough game to master but that adds to the fun of playing it. i think that the number one hardest thing with both the sharks and the divers is getting the perfect aim on your target so when you go to attack, it is almost a guaranteed kill. when playing as a shark, i would recommend aiming the diver up on the base of your dorsal fin and then rushing in for the attack.",1
"no support for any pads but xinput. upon first launch, forces you into a tutorial when you don't know the keyboard commands and can't open a menu. enter and escape backspace aren't the confirm cancel default keys. the servers are finicky and make crazy load times and sometimes drop you entirely. it doesn't use steamworks multiplayer probably because of the cross-plat thing so you're reliant on capcom's lousy servers to find your friends, let alone play with them. no arcade mode, shop isn't implemented not that i mind a lack of microtransactions but the way they hyped it up you'd think they'd have it running on day one also, it doesn't have even half the characters vanilla sfiv had at launch. i miss sakura.",0
"needs to be optimized, feels like a dayz knock off mechanics wise. badfps, again optimization required. as of right now not worth the wait to download and the lack of pve and no introduction ruins the game for novices",0
"get your controller out, this is a decent game if you're into sports basketball",1
i used cheat engine to hack lvl and money and i didnt get banned . not recomending ..,0
this game is full of bugs. i tried everything and still same crap. physics reinstal and still crash crash crash before the reace on the same spot. ea how could you release this crap and after so many years still full of bugs!!,0
"horrible just horrible so slow,freezes then crashes, and the whole story got out of control by the community. i even refunded this piece of crap. this better be the last game",0
only a few bosses in and loving it! there's no trash mobs to deal with and you get a wounder and sense of exploration from walking around the world. the bosses are very diffrent and challeing in their own way. some are easy to kill with one stratagie others not so much. i love this game ether way tho!,1
"this is not ace combat , , or zero. this barely even feels like an ace combat game. if you play this you will spend of the game struggling with the fact that the game is designed to try and force you into d.f.m. which is nothing more than a rail shooter chase scene with other planes to try and shoot them down. if you don't, you're going to learn real fast that the enemy planes can pull more t moves than hawx or the movie stealth. i want to like this game. and i can..if i consider it an airborne version of a call of duty game. not as an ace combat. here's to hoping ace combat does a better job since it's going back to the strangereal world.",0
"top quality tower defense. if you don't like tower defense, this isn't for you, otherwise just go ahead and buy it.",1
'this little piggy went to the morgue' out of,1
no option lt tutorial didn't cover all the ship control.,0
"although it's, off the bat, a really great game- minimal bugs, solid gameplay and stringent factors which vary the gameplay, it's not my cup of tea- as much as i'd love to get right into it, ship products all around the globe, captain and maneuver vessels whilst at the same time managing my company.. the gameplay becomes repetitive and tedious. don't get me wrong, the concept is awesome, the game is great complete, minimal bugs, finished project e.t.c - however it's just due to the repetitiveness- after playing just over mins, i kinda got borded of it. needless to say, i'm definitely going to have a look into transocean - a more refined and in-depth version of the game, due for release in . needless to say, the game is good, there are many aspects to it and are sure to keep the right person entertained. however, i just feel it's not for me- it's too repetitive and tedious for my liking.",0
old school shmups i tend to like are more in line with style. this has some good qualities just feels stiff and not really that fun. just can't recommend it. levels to choose from were you try to earn money to buy some upgrades. some look to disposable and some look like they may be permanent. i didn't get to far into it since i didn't play much. there's better shmups out there to play.,0
"simple, loot and level you character. expand the fun with your buddies which might be the main reason this game is awesome, or maybe its because there are zombies in it? i do feel the urge to splash some with my barbed baseball bat after watching the walking dead here virtually. the coop mechanics work well and besides the slightly complicated invitation-system and the controller optimized menus its good fun. the balancing is okay as well and is easy to learn. first tip for the off chance you might try this game don't settle near the beacon where the new game starting location. don t be a noob and make the same mistake i at first did. have fun",1
"this is the most depressing game i've ever played. it has some powerful messages. but it's slow and every movement and action is considered. whereas i think it's worth playing i'm not sure it's worth exaustive replaying as the stories it can tell don't have a lot of variety and wieght of some of the messages become lessened when you see the seams of the gmae and it's the same sad couple you could rob from, or the same sick people in need of help.",1
"while it's a very short game, i loved every minute of it. the puzzles are interesting and some were suprisingly challenging.",1
"executive 'hey, i have an idea! plants versus zombies is hella popular. let's rip-off everything about it!' executive 'but.. wouldn't that get us sued?' executive 'not if we 'add' to the gameplay by padding it out with the most mindless, needless and annoying busywork imaginable!' exectuvie 'why.. that's absolutely brilliant!' and so, they did. and it was terrible.",0
the good the unqiue ghraphics. the bad this game is completly unstable. even worse than platypus . get platypus instead.,0
"this game doesnt ing work when it's updating. once i try to close it and open it up again, it says 'cannot open up, game already running' which it is not. this game and whoever works with it. until it works, i do not recommend this game.",0
okay i fixed my promblem but my game says it running when its not and i cannot close it,0
this game truly a piece of crap. the grahpic choppy there not even as good as console version. the frame rate is bad very bad i mean down right awful. i did everything to increase frame rate. it as far that was only about . made it playsable but not enjoyable. i have frame rate moves at about during cutscene. combat boring and simple. you mash button over and over in different direction to get combos. i guess since this on pc where fast player of pc aren't good at fighting games i give it past. for hardcore fighting game such as myself it's a no. the story..lol anime story. but seriously. is pretty good following the last arcs in the narutos. the boss are intense with quick time event which i don't mind. bring flavor to the game. there tons of characters. some of them being double of same character but didn't seem bother considering the moveset are much different.,0
"it's a very fun mmo to play with friends. heck, it's even fun solo.",1
"found the visual style to be difficult to follow and the controls were lacking. i love the marvel characters, but the way they are presented here is kinda meh.",0
rome and shogun way better than this call of duty equivalent,0
"this game is great, i remember playing it it minecon , and it's changed soo much, it's great being able to explore a vast universe, and the best thing is that if you find a planet one of your other characters built on you will see and can take from your storage, and stuff!! this game is best played with friends, you can make a party and go on your other party member's ships!! you can teleport to each other and help with missions!! its great fun! i definitely reccomend this to anyone!!",1
"terrible game, nearly impossible to play.",0
"a really nice d multiplayer game, i play a lot with my friends! worth its price!",1
the onky reason i can't recommend this game is because it crashes waaaaaay too much.,0
"do you like bein hunted? do you like the rake? do you like waking up to pigs' heads on a stick outside your trailer? do you like exploring a world where you could be attacked any minute? do you like placing cameras that will be taken down in one night? do you like watching dear in their natural habitat? are you really into the rake?! sorry i had to if you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, this game is for you..",1
"this game is absolutely amazing! i love the graphics, storyline and nearly everything about it. i have owned it for days and have around hours played already!",1
"the game is simplistic, yet still sastifying. the best feature is the steam workshop and all of the maps and mods that include it. you can even play through the fire temple from the legend of zelda ocarina of time and it's so well done, includes the dragon boss battle !",1
"really cant recommend a racing game, where wheel support is a joke..",0
"ive played unreal tournament sence , i love this game its one of my all time favs. first person shooter with vehicles and lots of maps.. this game is one of the best old fashion games and one of my child hood favs. i would rate unreal tournament out of for the amazing gameplay and fun ive had playing. lots of customization fun maps out of",1
"the game its really short, but it doesn t mean its bad, i enjoyed and was really relaxing. it has art on it so if you are playing it, take your time and enjoy it.",1
"not as good as previous cod games. story line is not as good, way to many cut scenes with flashy screens that would cause an epiliptic person to fall out. only get on sale if you have nothing else to play.",0
"this is a pretty fantastic game. i'm glad i picked it up on a whim and got to play through probably about half of it last night. my guesstimate is there's probably - hours of total gameplay in the game the story is interesting, the interface is solid, and the banter back and forth across the radio is really entertaining. i can't wait to see where this game ends up!",1
"this barely works. if you're on windows , this will not work, at all. some people can get it working, i couldn't. however, if you own new vegas, you can buy this, download tale of two wastelands, and play it on new vegas's engine. fallout is a really good game and all that, but seriously, unless you know what you're getting in to, buyer beware.",0
"if you like your hopes for early access to get snuffed then you should buy this game. it'll only cost you , but a lombotomy would be a cheaper way to get the same thing done.",0
i tried really hard to like this game. i stilll play the first one occasionally but.. this one sucks the big one. i know it says i have hours played but honestly i only played maybe minutes. i fell asleep playing because it was so lame. and then just set the laptop down and went to bed. aweful aweful game. so sad,0
for the game and all you see is who made the game! they will fix it i hope and for now i'll say this game is a pos. i'm not going put effort in fixing it because they should be the ones that fix it not the person paying . hoping for multiplayer later on if the game ever works,0
"also known as the war z, a game so bad that steam actually refunded my purchase.",0
"note steam hasn't properly tracked the number of hours i've played. i have far more than what it says this is the best stealth game i've ever played. i love the powers that help you move around and remain undetected. i usually don't try to do special 'runs' in video games, like 'no gun run' or 'no powers run' but the stealth in this game was so much fun that i took the time to do a 'no kills' run and it was fantastic. watching patrol routes, finding places to hide unconcious bodies, and executing the perfect strategy while having no one see you is immensely gratifying in this game. i also love the save function. i can save at any point and retry a section until i do it the way i meant to. i don't like having to replay an entire level just because i messed up on one decision late in a level. this game lets me restart from where i want to as long as i saved. i can't wait for the next game to come out.",1
"i truly love this game. i put numerous hours into it and only stopped because i had to stop, uplay tightened its grip on this so much you can't even play it any more. i miss this game and wish i could play it again. the game is glorious. uplay is parasitic unnecessary garbage.",0
surround sound broken in linux port. game is stereo only.,0
"do not buy!! i bought this and was enjoying it until i reached the nursery. you are in the cellar and the only way out is a door that says unlocked when scanned but doesnt allow you to exit. i searched the web as you do for this and apparently it is a know glitch and has been apparent since the games launch on wii u in . here we are in and dont tell me steam were unaware of this, and the glitch is still not fixed or at least the fix hasnt crossed over to pc yet. definately do not buy!! apparently if you play for more than hrs you will not be entitled to a refund according to steam. disgusting imho when something is so clearly flawed .",0
this is brilliant. only bad thing is that there is no coop. edit oh they added a coop version..nm then this is a perfect game.,1
every frikin time i try to play this game i join a server and i leave in minute and a punkbuster error comes up. f k punkbuster,0
great game but needs best prices like baby tiny dragon egg for coins or make a area where you can get a egg and food for pet,0
". out of -------------------------------------------------- pros -great graphics -great engine -thrilling story line -humongous map -so much to do cons -poor usage of franklin -online encourages buying gta money -------------------------------------------------- overall, it's great.",1
"like a real arcade, but without the hordes of children and bad fast food. the tickets and prizes are a very cool addition. my daughter and i had fun playing it.",1
this is a blast from the past go get this and play it go now..what are you doing go get now!!,1
"i was pleasently surprised by this game. i was worried since my graphics card doesn't quite meet the minimum reccommendation, but so far it seems that mb doesn't count for much p pros game is great for teaching you if you know nothing about the game, like i did. graphics are amazing. the game is challenging, yes, but not overly so once you figure out your opponents strategy. the online is fun, well connected, and pits you against people of similar skill levels. cons it takes a long time to unlock more cards - though i was lucky enough to find a mythic in my first pack. the campaign has a pretty large difficulty spike after the tutorial one, which while not impossible to overcome takes a lot more practice. overall i would give it out of .",1
i love this game !!,1
if you like assembling and disassembling guns this is the game for you otherwise don't touch it,1
one of the best balances between fun and realism i've seen so far. of course this is of personal taste. best way i can describe is a mix between cod fast smaller maps and arma tactical realism . graphics are pretty good for a game. sound is great. the community is awesome. out of this is my the test of time award vote.,1
"it's like the new world order, full of bullies, racists, biggots etc. love it out of",1
"very fun to play. entertaining, interesting, pyschotic, none of that modern-fps bs except maybe gun limit but u get tentacles to play with anyways .",1
i cant shut or play the game it is running in the background and i cant exit it please help!,0
its ok a little tricky at some stages but the game is a little over price the graffit so so the story ok but stall not too bad of a game,1
"awesome game, imaging eve online light version vs the eve online now we have who is dark version. in ascent, you get to mine, craft, research, trade, build settlements, colonies, starbases, you get to explore new unknown systems, discover asteroid fields, claim planets for yourself. there is no pvp right now but the dev is working on it and with time you will have sectors dedicated for pvp protecting those players from pvp in other sectors. so the pve crowd will be pleased, the game has still a long way of improvements and the devs are always working to fix the bugs. there is an option to play the game for free after buying it here and then is the other option to subscribe for like a month that gives you more freedom int he building of colonies and star bases. give it a try you will not be disappointed. i give this game a out of",1
fsx is officially 'dead'. prepar d is too high price and strange with its license no entertainment usage?? o o so only xp now and thanks god it is xtra good!! but remember!! it is simulation!!,1
"tl dr at bottom for those of you who are lazy. i nominated this game for the 'test of time' steam award. why? i remember playing this game back in ' and ' at my friends place. we played everything from multiplayer, zombies, co-op campaign, the whole yards. i loved every aspect of it. once i bought my own xbox , i bought it. i played the outta it. lent it to a friend, he broke it. bought another copy. once i built my own pc, i bought it, again. and while the multiplayer is on its last leg of population, the zombies mode, solo or with friends, is still amazing. and i'm sure as everyone here knows, the custom zombies is where it is at. it is the game i will come back to years from today and still enjoy a good round of zombies. you want a pros cons list? easy. pros- almost everything except whats in cons list. cons- alt-tab is complete . mulitplayer is not populated. tl dr read the review you lazy .",1
warning game will cause eye strain and dizziness. you may also develop a phobia of shapes out of,1
"laggy , buggy and lack of control",0
"pros great story with hilarious dialogue, awesome graphics, great soundtrack, and pretty great gameplay with plenty of epic boss battles. cons no map which could get you lost a couple of times, even went backwards in the level a couple of times without realizing it, although the developer has flames placed to show you when your close to the exixt, they can only help you find the exit in the end cthulhu saves the word is a really good game, the only exception is that it's easy to get lost due to having no map. it's defiantly worth the money. out of",1
"hotel management simulation, not my definition of 'fun'",0
this game is really good i recomend it,1

"this game is great, don't get me wrong, but it's just too short. i have about hours on this game and i've already completed it, that's the biggest flaw with this game. if there was ever a sequel to come out, this is what i would want. -a longer story -a workshop -map editor and submiter -keep the extras menu -keep the time trials -add an extra reward for collecting bags also, keep the bags -keep the tutorial or even a hub world were you can practice your skills -no drm -a similar soundtrack but not the exact same tracks -a windows mode get it on sale if you're looking for somthing quick to play or for something different",1

you can spin in stations. who needs eve anymore?,1
"game is unplayable due to frequent crashes. after having it boot me back to the desktop literally less than seconds after i launched the game after yet another crash, i uninstalled the game. game itself is great, but i am afraid i cannot recommend it in its current state. maybe when k games decides to stop treating pc gamers like second-class citizens, you can give them your money. they wanted you to buy this game for the xbox . pc is an open platform, where as the xbox is an all-american brand. pure, handcrafted, americana soul. you will always get the definitive experience for the xbox or xbox one.",0
"the graphics are incredible though not well optimized. its a great game great experience but i wouldn't give this a out . more like a out of . mostly becauase of the fetching missions that simply just time fillers to give the game the apperance of being longer. it's main story isn't very compelling either its like they ripped it off from a far cry title that got canceled or something. its difficult for me to not recommend this, but considering i didn't feel compelled by the story to finish this game and it's a aaa title im going to say no. don't buy this, there are simply too many other games you should buy first before buying this game. this game would be good on a desert island, or a place with no internet. because watching youtube is more compelling than this game. which is sad because its beutifully designed graphically, though it isn't well optimized. it requires alot of juice to run this, because of the lack of optimization.",0

"got a free party hat, out of",1
"this game is just bland and boring. the vigors are cool at first, but there's not much to the combat after that. the game gets incredibly repetitive with fighting the same boring enemies over and over again, skylines don't do much to vary the combat either. the story is also a convoluted mess that tries to hard to be incredible and over the top that it just seems silly and the ending was simply not worth it. i was looking forward to this game so much after hearing the incredible things about it, but it failed to live up to any excpectations i had. there are better shooters to play, dont waste your time on this convulted piece of garbage. the graphics are nice though.",0

"moody atmosphere and compelling if somewhat mindless narrative keep this gritty drama rolling. well-acted and fine-tuned, the shoot-em-up starring a now-grizzled max payne stops just short of an eyeroll at times, but is an enjoyable game throughout that harkens back to vhs action cheese in the best ways.",1
"this game sucks more kuk than a hora that has been in buisness for years. knulla treyarch and their knullande bajs ops game with it's knullande god requirements for graphics and the moderknullande angels playing this piece of skit. if you are thinking about buying this load of h stavf ring, stop and think if you are the son of a knullande god. if you aren't, then buy a vuxenfilm subscription on verklighetskungar instead. if you are, ask zeus or thor or odin or knullande allah to give you power to penetrera people with that knullande drakon bajs sniper. knulla this, i'm out. d---- lt lt --bla-ck -o-p-s i-i-i gt gt en kuk",0
despite the game being out for some time now there are still endless glitches and random crashes. it's always comical to be some clothes with a sword waiving ahead of it fighting mobs that should just be terrified at this point of the ghost in front of them made by the many glitches of ac unity. my final point which ruined it for me was when my saved data both cloud based and local became corrupted after hours of play. i was really excited to play this game as someone who has live in paris but it was instead a huge disapointment. if only game designers understood we would rather have a complete finished product instead of rushed bs for a launch date.,0

"i have over hours of play time beta backer elite is one of the best space sims out there, and that is the problem, there's far too much space, the game is under populated, nothing to do apart from shoot things or pick up and drop off things, far too much grind, and the devs completely on their existing players with the horizons expansion pack, the fact if you buy the game after horizons you get the game and expansion, where as the loyal backers and early players have to pay an additional - for the expansion on top of what they already paid, to me it's a bad business move, the game has so much potential and yet after over a year they have worked on not the mechanics but the next expansion that has tore its fanbase in half, and all for the love of money.. poor shor frontier. i may return one day if they fix this beautiful barren mess of a game.",0

"what a pathetic excuse for a game. this one just sucks, no gameplay at all, you just walk and move the mouse cursor every single pixel of the screen until an exclamation mark appears, and about of the time it'll just get you jibberish like 'damn, this fcking locked, fuckload of f ck' and plenty of 'f words' thorough the game. also the game is incomplete, have tons of bugs and glitches not even the mouse cursor escaped, if you move your mouse too much, the game cursor will disappear and the windows cursor will pop up until you move the cursor to the dead point again . i'll give it out of because i got my money back selling the cards",0

"this is a wonderfully addictive puzzle game. you'll probably go back and forth between fixated and frustrated as you struggle to solve what has to be around a hundred or so puzzles. if you enjoy being pushed mentally, give it a go it's well worth it. if you're easily frustrated when you can't figure things out, perhaps it isn't for you. expect to spend about one weekend getting through the game before you're done.",1
"i actually couldn't believe these people released this as 'official'. it's borderline criminal to charge for this at present. it's so bad right now you can't even play single player offline without the game slowing to a crawl because of their servers. oh, and you have zero control over anything related to single player offline mode - period. no changing game states, no deleting, no renaming - literally no control over files supposedly located on your machine, locally. i wanted to like this game. i've followed it for months now. i couldn't even play for hours before i shook my head at this 'official launch' version and quit. or, more accurately, the game crashed and wouldn't let me change any settings. pass. update since seeing the titans 'expansion' joke i wish i could report uber for and sodomy. never touching anything these guys are attached to, ever again.",0

"after this many call of duty games they still haven't fixed the lag. lobbys are still full of hackers who get away with clearly auto-aiming everyone. call of duty to no surprise to anyone is still the ing same! if you get alot of kills you get scorestreaks which get you more kills which in turn get you more scorestreaks etc.. the rich get richer, which is not a fair system. everyone is mostly playing tdm which is just about the most boring gamemode ever invented, since there is no objective, it's just get x amount of kills before enemy team. player progression is still so long and tedious but required if you actually want a chance against high rank players fov higher than it states could cause graphical glitches which i experienced, this is ridiculous since most players use fov as default and more fov actually gives you an edge in combat. the game is clearly very poorly optimised.",0
"for a game that describes the main character like 'a god', there aren't many shooters where the player character is this un-badass. the combat is a bit like doom, if doomguy was slow-moving, had aiming troubles, and took a positively tedious amount of time to do the finisher animations.",0

great fun game to play with friends.,1
"i can't find how to set my controller up. for this reason i am not happy with my purchase. plus it is boring asf ok maybe i was a bit too hasty with my first review..i like it now. the controller is set up under the secondary keyboard controls in the settings which is . you should be able to do that under controller settings..duh. as far as it being boring well it is but in an adictive kind of boring way, which makes no sense but that is the way it is so deal with it. not really a game i like to play nonstop but it is great to play like an - hrs at a time.",1
i love this game. wish i had gotten into the mass effect game line sooner,1
"i was very excited about this game. while it is fun it does get a little repetitive for my tastes. also the campaign is just not very hard and static. i also found that with hypnosis it almost becomes too easy almost exploitatively so, especially when you add magic items to ensure that boss level creatures don't resist you. the non campaign game was more challenging, playing on the highest difficulty it was too hard, as the sk seemed to just blow up the mana nodes every turn. overall it was a fun game for a short while but i wouldn't recommend it until it gets around the pricetag.",0
"major lag when started up, than became unresponsive. wasted my money on a game that didn't work. how do i go about getting a refund ?",0

worst game ever. won't play it again ever - out of ruins lifes. oh and russians are kindof annoying too,0
"great game more than my expectation! goods - it works with win bit and x controller, widescreen is supported but stretched a little. - it remains a lot of ps era game designs and i found it is still fun to play nowadays. - the character model is well created and so enjoyable to watch it fight. - some background objects can interactive to perform fatalities. - rayne has a nice body and she performs bloody fatalies to her rivals bads - the x controllers lt rt is recognised as axis instead of button - the default control scheme not optimised and you need to reconfigure it everytime you start the game - the hitting is not 'attached' to the target and not felt being hitted - the voice acting is just meh and the sound effects is bad, the explosive sound is awfully loud total . out of",1
"don't bother!! this software is horrendously inconsistent. i have lost at least hours in the past two days to this piece of junk. has a tendency to not finish files of correctly and leave them as .tem extensions. not fun after you've been waiting for minuets. i've also had three crashes where it just continues counting down but isn't actually doing anything. when it works its fine, but if you want to render anything that's longer than a few minutes look elsewhere. huge let down!!",0
"i wasn't even able to play a single match, my hours on this game was just on loading times and downloading updates. the updates in this game takes frustratingly large amount of time to download here.",0
i would say only buy it when its on sale. its a good game but not that good.,1
"edit well, it is a delayed edit, but while you can see my initial review, it is confirmed by the devs that the game will remain broken, so i would advise you not to but it in a pc. however, if you own a ps , it is enjoyable for what it offers and the story is very good. has some truly spectacular moments well, i cannot say do not buy the game, cause the game is good, i just advise you to wait until either the goty edition or the release of a lot of patches that fix the bugs pf the game.",0
"if you liked the voiceovers from the avengers films but would rather the visuals were done in lego, this game is for you. otherwise, you'd be better off just playing lego marvel superheroes, because it's basically just that. the differences are -no characters marvel doesn't own the cinematic rights to -no map in the open-world segments, making manhattan pretty much impossible to navigate -crashes randomly",0
"one of the first sonic games i've owned. well, i have played old sonic games, but i rented them for my ps . this is a really swell and awesome game, even though it lags for me.. if it does happen to lag, try turning vsync off and lowering the shadow quality in settings, it helps. so anyway, sonic generations is a very swell game for all you sonic fans and a good way at playing old classic sonic levels in an all-new hd style! really funny cutscenes as well. it kinda sucks that classic sonic can't speak, but hey, it's pretty interesting!",1
"i start playing and think 'cute'. then the language is off, to the point of making the instructions confusing. then i come to see this is a very simple resource allocation game where you order droids to counter an onslaught of enemy droids. then i think 'hmm..that sounds familiar.' this is almost exactly like that resource allocation game where you order plants to counter an onslaught of zomblies. the difference? the language in pvz isn't off and pvz is f p. i applaud whoever worked so hard on the art, but sorry, this is not terribly original and definitely not how i thought i'd be killed on something called death by gameshow. maybe the devs need to revisit the seminal works in the death-by-gameshow genre smashtv and the movie the running man.",0
"this may say i don't reccomend it but i do, it's just the problems i have with the game it's self i mean it is a fun game and you can get hooked for a while but it is very p w and you may say it isnt since most things in the game can be done by famring etc but the farming for things like prime gear is just horriffic and you can ony have certain amounts of things unless you buy more inventory spaces with plat plus you cant sell weapons you own so if you buy some mk 's you can never get rid of them and your just stuck being forced to play with bad weapons and bad gear unless you pay and or buy no other weapons and just craft your own even then farming for blueprints is horrible but what can i say last time i played was months ago so the game could have changed but yeh this is my opinion and mine alone so if you have a propblem i don't care this is just what i think of the game",0
"come for the scares, leave to go vomit in the toilet and then come back to see what other abominations the dev thought up. think if putt-putt was drawn by the people who did foster's home for imaginary friends and styled it more like binding of isaac x . a bit expensive since it's quite short unless you want acheivements. if you're skeptical, wait for a sale. it's fun and cool.",1
"pretty fun game, kinda cancer player base, some mods, some hacks, some glitchs, id say out of not bad",1
"so far, so good. plays like an awkward beat hazard clone. i like the stylized video, but there is something overall.. off.. about this game. the creators try to set up a story-- good on them. beat hazard doesn't really have one. but.. it makes no sense. and the gameplay itself is never explained. what does pew-pewing roughly hewn electronic faces have to do with defeating demons afterall? i'd like to seen some vastly different gameplay, even something pac-man like would have been better. t then there's just-- this.. awkward tone. like there's soft piano music between tracks, yet there's demons poorly hewn ones with overdone cliches abounding everywhere-- from the voice to the glowing eyes . and.. there's soft piano music with this throwback like-- visual boy on a neon graphic set. neons? classical music? symphony? demons? space ships? whut?",0
"i would recommend this game as it is immensly fun, but seeing as how alot of ppl are having trouble including me starting the game up i would say just dont waste your money on this game. i have had it for about days now and havent gotten a single second of play time, even let it load for hours with nothing to show. all in all its a great game but it probably wont work, so i would recommend just buying the cd's, save your money.",0

"this war of mine is an emotional game about the other side of war. with all going on, it's difficult to stick to your morals and beliefs in this game as you'll be forced to do things that you would originally never do in your lifetime in order to survive! this war of mine is a great strategy game that leaves me thinking about how great i have it at night.",1

this game is best played free. the russian t- is over powered and german tanks are like make of glass. recommended only if you play as a russian tank.,0
"rating - . out of stars. it's super easy to just pick up and play. the user interface is well thought out. while appearing deceptively simple, this game actually has a lot of depth. it's endless, not really a sandbox, but it just keeps going on as long as you play. replayability. there are so many types of monster tennants you can have. the graphics are silky smooth d, and go great with the soundtracks that play. the game overall just looks great. the only con i could find is a few small annoyances related to text in the game, which could be polished up a little bit, but do the job well enough. in summary, i say if you have four bucks, get this game now.",1
"it took me about seven minutes to play this game. i was a bit lost at first. fitting, really. i suppose a fly would feel lost too in such a vast universe. and insignificant. what's a fly in the great equation of the cosmos? after the initial uneasiness caused by the realisation of playing as an insect wore off, i started to ascend. because everyone needs a purpose - a plan. might as well try to see the world from a higher perspective. and that was when the boredom gave its place to curiosity, then to fear. and sympathy. the moment the fly got to relative safety i felt such a feeling of relief. as i kept asceding and the environment changed to something more symbolic, i realised that silent tears were running down my cheek. i was so immersed in the moment i didn't notice i was crying. when the final scene began to unfold, all i could think of was 'oh no, oh no, oh no..'. and then, silence. the shock and regret was too profound. do yourself a favour and try this. it's such a masterful piece of art for the price of nothing.",1

"i picked this up because a good friend played it and spoke fondly of it. from great voice acting, an engaging story, and unique characters, i can say hands down this is one of my favorite point and click games. my only complaint is the game is rather short. at about hours long, i wish the game was longer. i would have enjoyed it more to spend more time with detective grimoire. i really enjoyed this game.",1
"i completed this in minutes while i was bored. they tried to do a telltale thing, but because none of the characters are interesting and, again, you can complete it in half-an-hour it's a failure. i see this better as a demo to show off story-telling in games and how it could be harnessed, but that's clearly not what the creator s were going with as there's worth of dlc for this. i know what you're saying, 'the game is supposed to be replayed to get different endings, like the stanley parable', and that's a good point. however the stanley parable has a sense of interaction and the changes in there drastically change the story, unlike in this game where it doesn't really. i replayed the stanley parable because i knew that there were so many different options i could take that would create an entirely different ending, including an ending where you play a minigame for hours, but i did not replay this game. this would be better as a browser-based demo where the dlc was unlocked while playing the game.",0

"as big a visual improvement half-life source is over the original, it's sadly riddled with bugs. on first play, i wasn't able to progress past the first chapter as the game script appeared to be broken when a security guard or scientist was supposed to open a door for me but wouldn't. there are also numerous sound and rendering issues, such as weapons being invisible and the sound of your gund being played in the distance. there's a particularly nasty bug on one of the levels where a storm drain is blocked by a grate that isn't meant to be there. the only way past was to use the noclip cheat. with the original half-life on steam for the same price, the graphics won't be as good but you won't get these game-destroying bugs. avoid.",0
a new paid dlc basically every month? no thank you.,0
"hey rockstar let me tell you something. if you let people mod this game, take away the grind for money in mp, get on that hacker problem and finally update the singleplayer.. yeah i might consider giving you a thumbs up",0
this game finds a way to scare you. the way it does this is by boring you out of your mind and then suddenly throwing a piece of gameplay at you other than walking around. this instantly shocks you because your brain had been turned off from the sheer excitement of walking,0
"there is no challenge in this game, you just click and click and click. there is nothing to lose except feeling in your clicking finger",0
"i do not recommend playing this game, unless the developers give me waffles. in that case, i change my mind.",0
"after finishing the first part of this series which i did not really enjoy due to frustrating gameplay, combat, cutscenes, elevators etcetera, but did enjoy for the story i just had to play this part aswell. oh boy this was one hell of an adventure, loved the story, loved the missions, the characters, the decisions you have to make, no annoying gameplay like the last. definitely a must have.",1
"one of, if not the worst game i've ever played. never buying another game ryan suggests ever again.",0
"i have simply few words to describe this game except 'don't buy it' i spent nearly nothing on it because of steams habit of giving fantastic deals sadly this is the only game i've ever bought and truly regretted even though it was and i bought it years ago, it still annoys me greatly that it sits in my library mocking me.. but it serves as a reminder to check the reviews first!",0
one of the best games ever.,1
"metal slug defense is a casual, laid-back, tower defense game that consists of a base on both ends of the map. players can have a deck of up to units maximum to send out to advance towards the enemy base and then watch them battle to the death. but there's a catch, after a certain time limit has passed the player may use their 'metal slug attack' ability which sends out a flashing tank that charges across the map and mows through weak units and explodes on contact with heavy units. there are various factions in-game where if your deck consists of a single faction, you can get hp bonuses for the round. one may find the game to become extremely repetitive due to the lack of challenge, and this is coming from playing the ios version of the game where you won't have to deal with any pay--win scams. but unfortuntately, you will never see any of the above description since the game doesn't even launch. play on ios or android instead or try out their better title 'metal slug attack' pros uninstall button works just fine. cons bruh dont even get me started",0
"do not play it on realistic, your team ai goes full and the enemy shoot you from the smallest of gaps hell, it feels like they are shooting through the wall half the time! controls are confusing, i spent more time trying to figure them out that actual gameplay. when i command an ai to move somewhere, they won't half the time or they walk right into the ray. there needed to be an attack button or something.. also they won't throw nades when they are able to, saying 'unable to do that' even though there are no obstacles around them.",0
"i would recommend not wasting your time on this game, it's very unbalanced. headshots hardly do any damage compared to bodyshots. on top of that the hitboxes are tiny.. you basically need to use a whole clip to kill someone. poor weapon choices per merc, and once you start the game you're stuck with one card loadout. -boosters are garbage and hardly 'boost' any coin. -it will take you a while to gain any new mercs with the coins given per game. -the rounds are really really short.",0
"when respawning in call of duty isn't frustrating enough, this game has got you covered. ten outta ten.",1
"la-mulana is a gem of pure gameplay, based on exploration and old-school action, also an extremely well-thought-out metroidvania. the game may not appeal to everyone, for its challenging difficulty, but it is exactly what it was designed to be.",1
great game! constant fps p on a gtx .,1
this game is pretty good.,1
"so close to being acceptable, but the fact that you can only have so many cards at once ruins it unless you throw money at the m for extra 'slots' of course . the simple ability to card collect all the heroes and villains would be fun by itself, but even that is ruined with microtransactions.",0
"this game not finish yet, everytime i play matchmaking, i always stuck at loading screen, i've tried many ways to make this game works, like low resolution, if i play solo, i can play it very nice.. i got fps on normal setting, but in match making still stuck at loading screen, i hate this bug, please game creator.. finish this game, you make window at app, so it will need more ram, i have gb ram, and its not enough for this game, cause.. pysicaly memory run at task manager, i play the other game like 'gta ' its run very well, but.. this game.. make me angry. and mind blowing, and review for the gameplay, its so nice, you just need to repair the launcher, bug at loading screen, and ram leaking.",0

"attention all rpg lovers.. this game is a classic and is not to be missed. yes, there are some bugs but just download the unofficial patch and you're golden. so much love went into making this game. it is totally and completely worth it. i wish i had played it earlier! want to see the game before you buy it?",1
"i'm not able to put the finger on it but the game is quite boring. on one side to simplified placing extension on a colonyscreen, why bother, a statusscreen like in master of orion should also do the trick on the other side to detailed placement of guns on the screen, spacefights,.. i loved mmo mmo but stardrive is lacking in a lot of parts. if you are really into space simulation games, give it a try, anyone else, keep away",0
the stock market is completely bugged. i don't know what to do. i buy a stock and it's only refreshing after two or three in-game days and of course i lost lots of money trying to analyse what's wrong . at this time i can't recommend this game. rockstar's support is nowadays completely unaware of the people trying to play this title. ridiculous!!,0
this is one the worst games i have ever played. the game is not difficult at all. you can literally spray bullets at your enemies while you walk backwards and they can't hit you. the graphics are just brightly colored blocks and the entire soundtrack is dubstep. all in all this game is just bait for year olds.,0
"i don't know who telltale are, i am apparently the rare person that doesn't. as a casual fan of minecraft i thought a story mode would be great however i was largely uninterested and had to find reasons to 'play' this, well not really play it, it is an interactive movie. i was expecting something a bit more minecraft like rather than an homage to minecraft. the fan made stuff is better, i would have rather spent the money on minecraft lego in retrospect if i wanted a theme-only product.",0
i refuse to shovel out money to constantly released paid dlc packs that should be part of the game you pay for.,0

"i love this game, i've been playing the board game version since the days of nd edition. now i play it in the board version from an excellent board game publishing company fantasy flight games. i'm currently waiting for the newest expansion the woodlands which add's a forth corner to the board. the digital version here keeps the game true to it's core values and even showed me a few rules i had completely missed. i highly recommend this to anyone that loves rpgs, stragety games, and fun, light-hearted competition to claim victory.",1
what if limbo but nazis? and guns. and way too precise physics puzzles.,0
"finished the game in just a few hours. too short. unsatisfying ending. buy if its bucks, nothing more, and even thats generous. there were moments of brief tension, but the overall story built up something much larger that ended up falling flat. voice acting is superb, but thats probably the only pro regarding the game. out of",0
i had this game for the and loved the hell out of it. so when i got rid of my i didnt regret buying it for my laptop for only bucks. i think anyone looking for a challenge or just a good action rpg should try it. just be ready to die,1

"frictional games have struck gold again with their latest offering of horror a reverently beautiful amalgamation of amnesia, bioshock and doom , perfected with a thought-provoking story, interesting characters, satisfying ending and a desolate setting, dripping with tension, terror and detail. the monsters don't command the same presence as their amnesia brethren did, and some of the character models are a little wooden, but this hardly detracts from the brilliance of soma. frictional games solidify their position as behemoths of the genre. out of",1

is so stupid it just loads then becomes a white screen and says dark souls has stoped,0
so confused with the user interface not user friendly i can't found sea server.,0
this is really a beautiful game. i wont' spoil anything. but it's very simpllistic. and has a bit of humor. but it's just a nice relaxing play.,1
"addictive and fun. might experience a few crashes when you get too many entities, but the experience is worthy for its cost. i personally find it rather repetitive after a few levels, but honestly it doesn't really matter as you just gain more as you move on and brings more challenge as time passes. out of",1
a difficult city builder where you spend more time worrying about the harvests and winter than actually planning your city.,1
"i totally recommend this, it is somewhat scary on some levels, some arent! the art is nice! the story line is very very good! it might be a little short-medium, but this game is very good! the puzzles are very nice too some are evil and difficult but a challenge does not hurt . you can also play this game with an xbox controller! and don't be afraid if u get scared from horror games! this is a good starter! and i surely recommend this game for beginners on the horror genre to start trying and playing more of the horror genre! music and soundtrack is pretty nice too! rating out of i didn't give it a out of because it is a little bit on the short medium side but still a very good game! i even made a let's play series out of this! youtube video let's play - horror fox plays master reboot - part nbsp",1
"i beat it just to say i beat it. i kept wanting the game to be better than 'average', but it never was. there were no moments that were epic. everything was just 'acceptable'. cons i couldn't figure out the difference between any of the weapons i couldn't care about the story no wow moments.",0
it's ok but a little shallow. dare i say dumbed down worth euros max.,0

i'd rather stick my in a bee's nest.,0
"have you ever played any original game? that is nothing like anything else.. well that is most similar to tower defence, but still. not quite. it has it s fun parts and is a frkn time killer. it s an indie game. but are you willing to pay bucks for something you re gonna play for max hours? yes!",1

"do not buy this game if you are expecting an rpg fantasy, it's not. it has most certainly has rpg elements and fantasy elements but its just an average game. this is literally the most average game i have ever played. its nothing special, normal gameplay that isn't exactly fun, i was turned off almost immediately. clunky transitions from story to game that you feel like you missed something. it also just has an almost useless prologue that really does not have to be there. i mean, its a game, maybe you'd like it, but don't be decieved, it is no skyrim it is no dragon age, it is no proper dungeon crawler it's a game, that is overwhelmingly average! even the glitches are average. and average score of out of but no, it was really boring . out of",0

a disgusting remake of a great game. this new version is almost totally different from the original. my only connection to thid gsme is my attempt to get a refund. recommend you do not waste your time and money.,0
"is it elite? yep it's elite jazzed up with st century gfx, vr capable, and a good community built behind it. so if you enjoyed the original elite, or like the idea of space combat trading simulation with reasonable flight physics, then this is a good game. however .. as far as multi player goes, it's still in its infancy. the potential for griefers, or just outright exploit bullying, is there, making the solo mode far more preferable if you don't want to have to deal with smegheads. the lack of playable demo modes makes it hard to justify paying so much s cold - especially with the horizons espansion pack that's just been released, which means you have to fork over the same price you paid for the core game - and i'm not sure what it adds to justify that price tag because, no demo to check that out from . i remember the original elite, so there's a nostalgia value in the game for me right now but i don't know if that'll be enough to keep me interested enough to make this a regular game once the newness reminiscing wears off.",1
"if you wanna waste your money, buy this game. short story, in addition not a great western experience",0
"i cant recommend this game to other players, at least not the multiplayer part, i have enjoyed a lot of time in this game, but the multiplayer is hell, no matter how many servers you try in one day, in all of them there will be a hackar or a modder, ing up everithing and being a like all of them tend to be . from my point of view, rockstar isnt doing anithing to solve this, or at least if they are doing something, its not enough, if they dont solve this the multiplayer is going to become hackerland, if it is not hackerland yet.",0

made me love the cube. for real.,1
"i realise a lot of people dislike this game because of the pay win crap.. yeah, the pay win takes a lot of fun out of the game, but hey, its still pretty fun. there are some great gamemodes, i personally like the gamemode 'storm' because once i got kills on there. i have at least or more hours of gameplay put into the game, yeah. it's worth it if you can deal with the pay win aspect. edit this game is god awful. don't buy it. no. recent update made it awful, i spent hours fo my life grinding trying to get a bolt action rifle and now its so hard to get money.. dont waste your time, and money! life is precious, don't waste it playing pay win crap like this!",0
"this is a amazing game, made by a bunch of greedy s. when i first bought this game i loved it, but now the stupid dlc, dumb ai and developers made me hate it. overkill was once a good studio, they made a great game wich they are now milking all the money out of. pros -good community -fun gameplay -nice selection of weapons -nice graphics cons -tons of useless dlc -very little maps - devs -game poorly made -half the game is dlc",0

this game is so fun d,1
"i don't write reviews often, but i really enjoyed and would recommend wolfenstein the new order. it starts out as a fairly generic cod clone, but as the game evolves it becomes signficantly more fun. the gun play is very satisfying and the enemies are often challenging. the story is what really sets this game apart and makes it fairly special. all in all, i highly recommend wtno.",1
"good, but too short. i'm hoping that gearbox and blackbird will offer additional maps and, preferably, a second campaign. couple downsides, besides length. there is a serious lack of options in the skirmish mode. no way to increase starting resources, for instance. ship variety is low for a homeworld game, with a heavy rock-paper-scissors approach that the original game and cataclysm lacked, but was found in hw .",1
extremely fun and very addicting p,1
"it's professor layton meets fargo. the game is roughly hours long and contains roughly puzzles total making for a short game, but with a very good story behind it. it is a point and click but does not contain any puzzles 'out in the world' like the usual point and click. contains a very interesting clicking mechanic which will reveal places that can be clicked on within an area where you clicked, which keeps the game to the story and puzzles.",1

"my 'friend' you may remember him from my ghost train vr review is at it again. he bought me this game tonight. you see, my 'friend' understands that i like a lot of idle incremental clicker type games. he figured 'this should be something he'll enjoy' as he gifted it to me. he was wrong. this is a bad game. it's obviously supposed to send you the message that sweatshops suck and it does it by having a very sucky experience of play. you playing this game feels like working at a sweatshop. the progression is entirely too slow not 'incremental' enough it requires entirely too much actual attention to make progress not 'idle' enough, too much 'clicker' and about the only entertaining aspect of it is the music, which was more likely than not public domain. so for a genre that's already at the bottom of the barrel in terms of entertaining, this game is the bottom of that barrel.",0
"this is the best, very unique vibe",1
not worth the price at the moment but by no means is this a bad game. just needs a price cut and i will be playing it.,0

'get the out go go go' and every dies etc. idk.. i don't like that fact that im forced into this role of a man i don't give a about and im stuck trying to figure out what the is going on with this big white general who sounds like a total explain to me with little detail what im doing and why im doing it.",0

so funy to play you well have fun,1
"one of my many childhood games here, the pc version of star wars battlefront ii brings me back to when i used to play online on my ps . gamespy servers are now shut down, but there are fixes around that. this game is amazing, honestly one of the most perfect games i have played.",1

"i know there's been a lot of controversy about the game though recent updates have made the experience a bit more silky smooth. i've seen performance increases with each update. this is basically the world's best planet exploring simulator, although it's disappointing that it didn't live up to early trailers or the hype. the quest for the atlas path is not to be undertaken unless you want a huge slab of emptying sadness with the final result - same goes for the centre of the universe, though i would recommend this game if you want to get out and explore a few new planets for a short amount of time. combat is adequate. alien encounters are a binary choice of hostile or non-hostle. inventory management is still a chore. i'm sure more improvements are in the works although it is a shame that the game could have been so much more.",1
"fun, challenging, and good physics",1
this game really is an unplayable mess. the menu system is a total failure. controller support is very sketchy. physics are all wrong. the graphics on some of the trucks are okay though primative but everything else looks like the worst d images the n had to offer.,0

"pros -you can build your own deck -lots of achievements -has single and multi-player modes -decent music cons -ai is very predictable, and always seems to have the more fun to play cards -you have to pay to get good cards, and invest a lot of money for a good deck -no two headed giant mode -terrible controls and terrible performance -anything set to be done automatically is never optimal -terrible starting decks",0
"this game is terrible, stay away. sucks some serious",0
kinda boring after playing minutes since everything is so repetitive. glad i got it on sale.,0
played it for couple of minutes. died cause i was out of oxygen. almost died becuse of motion sickness.,0
"in my personal view, the game is great in many levels but also lacks in many more. having the oportunity to purchase the game again, i would not do it. i would look at how it progresses in the reviews, see what new content is made for it. see if mods will be available, etc. before buying it.",0
coop not working.. like at all.. literally unplayable cannot connect to session,0
"a fun game when it works, but the game's ai is almost unforgivably bad. i understand this is meant to encourage multiplayer games between humans, but finding a fair and balanced game is just as difficult for a new player, and if a game is going to try to have a single-player version it needs to be more than the token effort this game has supplied. the number of times the ai opponent clearly anticipates the cards in your hand that it's not supposed to know you have, or will obviously work together against you in multi-ai opponent games, will leave you tearing out your hair in frustration. don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the game, and have fun playing it, but that's more from the simple enjoyment of m tg itself. purely objectively looking at this game, it is riddled with flaws that in most other franchises would instantly see it uninstalled and never played again. buy it if you're a fan, enjoy it while you can, but don't buy this expecting a classic that will change your life.",0
where to begin.. well the game is pretty fun and pretty addicting but multiplayer is a big bucket of smashed s. i think elsword is the only game where i was ever brutally spamed by a level player. this is where i said bull because if a level can defeat me as for me being level then there is somthing horrifically broken with the game. so i did a little research and relised these people that were utterly destroying me had wins and losses. now this is an impossible feat. and yet this type off bs goes unchecked. now if you play it by yourself its an ok game but pvp is broken. i never ever cheat in mmorpgs but appearently everyone else does in elsword. if you like pvp then dont try elsword.,0
"was really excited for a singstar type game for pc - but given that i stopped singing to talk to my dog midway through a song and it kept marking my notes as correct, i'm rather dubious and not impressed.",0
"dcs world is a very good simulation. it takes quite some time to get to know the su- t aircraft that comes for free with the game, but it's definitely worth it. personally, i recommend robert sogomonian's youtube tutorial series on the su- t to get you started. it's a great experience to take off, fly a route, destroy some targets and land safely all on your own. recommended!",1
i have had a lot of fun a lot of fun with planetary annihilation and getting titans made my expearience with the game a lot better. after hrs on the vanilla game its nice to get some new content. obviously the game has its bugs sometimes but the game is getting better every update and this addition is a welcome sight to pa in my eyes. the new units and maps really change up the game play and make new stratigic possibilities open. overall id give the update a out of . love the new content but and map designs but i really wish they would finish polishing the game but as it stands right now its still a solid game. i would recommend this to people with computers with decent power the game is bit hard to run on good setting unless you have a decent computer.,1
"i really love dead by daylight, but honestly in it's current state, it's impossible to play lol i can't comprehend the unreasonable amounts of crashes on my non-trashy computer this game has done. it's random and completely dumb. also, the game is now killer favoured, games vs micheal in a row lol",0
"a great game, particularly for its mmo aspect. campaign mode isn't much to speak of, imo. and btw, for anyone who is expecting split-screen multiplayer, the pc version does not support split-screen offline multiplayer. for myself, the player split-screen was really the reason i bought this game, and i had already installed it before i realized that split-screen wasn't supported on pc. quite a bummer, but . . . too late now! so anyway, don't expect split-screen, and don't expect much from the campaign mode, cause it ain't much! so yeah . . . still a great mmo fps tho!",1
"beef spooky's house of jumpscares is probably one of my favorite horror games. there's a ton of references to other horrorgames i'm someone who's easily spooked, and my friends have most certainly enjoyed hearing my screams in panic when the cutest little squid pops up in my screen. i have also enjoyed the screams of a bunch of my friends in the same way. i recommend anyone to make a friend play this while at their house or screensharing during a call. some of the enemies are actually more challenging than i had thought, and it took quite a while till i beat the final boss i must say i'm not really a pro gamer though and it's completely free",1

when i st lo k on this game i ask of my friend..dude when driving truck could you see others player and honk each other..he said no just single player game..i said ok i just bought it gave a try..and i was amezed the graphic and real simulator style ..even playing in sp its was great i feel not bored just feel so relaxing..some of my friend made joke i look as a fool driving with al on road of me not playing multiplayer mod but for me its not about just a game is about hobby how u feel the game..if anyone feel sucks dont had multi well you just dont know how to enjoy a simulator games about,1
"game has been abandoned by devs. it s a unfinished game. despite the game show has great potential, good graphics, good content, unfortunately i can not recommend it now as this buggy in a way that does not allow me to play more than the time i played so far because there is a bug in the displayed interface when playing at , screens overlap and it is not possible to click on the options presented in the game. even traveling through space, where you should spend most of the time, to set priority repair or cleaning of compartments your ship responsible for the crew, they do not follow it .. by these two factors most the first the game is over for me. it may prove to be a good game in the future when all the bugs have been corrected, but not now. the game does not support screens!!",0
cqc is not worth it and i feel offended elite would even try to get on the same level as call of duty because duty is so beneath it!,0

"this game is great. it's made by just one guy, and many waited patiently for him to finish this game. the attention to detail he's put into the game is great. a few things will even catch you out - and the game was merely released days ago, so it's bound to improve in the future. it's really worth the buy. you'll have to get used to it at first, as you'll probably have a famine like i did.",1
"you would have to be a stupid game greater , if you dont realize that you can't leave players with no access to more units coming on line to continue the battle. max unit allocated are you guys for real. you will probably realize, too late, only after your greation crash and burn before your very eyes, that such a small ajustment would have made this game of yours, extraordinary.",0

go buy door kickers instead.,1
this game is awesome i have played through it before and i love the fighting and the story. this is the most singleplayer fun i have had since skyrim came out. i love this game.,1
probably -the- perfect retro game! it feels like a mix of hundreds of s jump n run games clustered together. the story too is quiet a psychological challenge. theres alot of meta philosophy going on. makes me all melancholic. the only thing i might criticize you cannot jump on enemies and it feels so much like you want to! but this is a choice of design. ..its still alot of fun!,1
"i really have to say, years ago, this game was much more interesting.. now, its almost impossible to play without usin cash! but hey, try urself! i love the different parts of the world n the fashion is rly nice, same as pets. skills are not much animated, bt i've seen much worse games. if u dont take games too much serious, go n play it a bit. if u find the right ppl, its really fun!",1

this game is absolutely amazing. if you like the style of the older pokemon games with the game style and theme of harvest moon then you'll thoroughly enjoy playing this game. it has a unique storyline and plenty of things to do to keep you active while playing through various activitys. out of lt,1

forced multiplayer that interferes with singleplayer - with the option to constantly pay real insurance money to not loose stuff in a singleplayer game.,0
"so i went into this game hopeful. the intro cutscene was a little lackluster with a thick dousing of fantasy garble. the first scene you play through you begin to notice the writing is a little forced and maybe not the games strong suit. continuing past a leap-frog styled tutorial you finnally get your hands on some combat, and its not much better. this continues for a few levels. and then it happens. you find youself infront of your first real boss which is actaully just a random mob by the name of something that started with a y and rolled around the keyboard for few strokes. you will know him as buffzilla the minute encounter. he cloaks himself so you can't attack him for three turns. all the while he is healing and shooting up buffs like a junky just out of the drunk tank. your party members will have have a few turns to kill him before he goes ghost again and heals back whatever little damage you could pour onto him cause bro accuracy is a . he is a standard mob encounter. commence the grinding or peace out. out of peace'd out",0
"movement and ui is very clunky--completely designed for a controller that lacks the grace and fluidity of mouse keyboard. save points are few and counterintuitive--one would think that meditating or fast travelling would generate a save, but not always. i find i'm pressing and re-pressing 'quicksave' over and over again, not very immersive. story, length, and graphics get thumbs up. this is my first witcher, so i'm disappointed to find i have to use the same ugly gervalt throughout the story, but that's a small matter. combat is 'okay,' but not thrilling--and somewhat annoying because i'm always accidentally switching off the sign i want. combat suffers from the same ui clunkiness, hard to tell when i can move attack action and when i'm stunned or recovering or whatever. i feel i have little control over combat. all in all, rather disappointing.",0
"downloaded everything, ran the game, useless error 'message' that only prompted me to submit the report, so i did that. even reinstalled the game. too bad, looks fun.",0

"a dark, beautifully written, downright entertaining work of art. the style is an obvious nod to the late, great h.r. giger, but with it's own unique feel. they've perfectly captured the dark and forboding biomechanical world that they were aiming for. the puzzles are tricky, but not too difficult.i found that i never got stuck on one puzzle for long, but i never seemed to breeze through them too quickly, either. perfect paciing, i would say. it is plainly obvious that the developers of this game put a tremendous amount of love into this game. they have got to be some of the most dedicated point amp click adventure fans in the world to have put together something this great. it's a modern work of art. i don't do that whole number rating thing because it's pretty arbitrary and pointless but i will say that if you are a fan of the point and click adventure genre, this game is an absolute must have, if you love surreal, biomechanical style artwork, this game is a must have. if you like a good, dark story, this game is a must have.",1

game is too chaotic for me. can't handle the controls well.,0

"i wanted to love this game, i really did. mech fighting suit in space? why aren't there more like that? but it just doesn't work here. the suit is hard to control and feels sloppy. the battles are repetative, mostly because you die so easy and so have to hide all the time. nothing really that cool looking in space, which is sad.",0
"more of an expansion pack than a whole new game. really dislike the quests especially those at odds with popular opinion e.g. killing 'bugs' or carrying out espionage. the lack of diversity with military units poor but i do like the army wide improvements. the trade posts also frustrate as they invariably land where it is ideal to send a colonist unit. lack of intelligent aliens also weak, if no higher species availale a greater diversity of aliens would be good, flying ones for example. gone back to civ v, just completed a game and now there is an option to carry on 'beyond earth', click on it and it leads you to the new game, really reiforcing the feeling of an expansion rather than whole new game. so if i do start a new game all the tech i learnt is now redundant, my cultural etc. advantages are wiped etc. at least give me additional time to settle the new planet if i have beaten all the other nations into space.",0

"im loving this game so far. the only issue im having is the mouse input sometimes spins me in a random direction. but as far as playability frame rates, crashing.. no problems. i give it out of i would give it a out of if the graphics looked a little better and the mouse issue was fixed along with other people no being able to play.",1
"interesting concept, almost requires a controller. very addictive, but i would have appreciated some sort of tutorial as to the concept of the game. for those of you who don't know side scrolling beat-em-up with rpg elements and randomly generated maps. when you die, you can choose one of three children to continue your quest.",1
this kid is tripping balls man. out of goty,1
i would rather be felated by a blender than play this game.,0
"darkest dungeon is a really cool idea and a really unique gaming experience. it's also grindy as hell and barely avoided outstaying its welcome with that unique experience. but then they added 'never again', which drastically inflates expected time to complete the game, with lots of utterly pointless grinding. so, i can't in good conscience recommend it, unless you desperately want to grind away at an unforgiving game.",0
"i used to think this game was good, then this csgo thing came to it and showed the true greed and retardation of the devs. no mods, all melee weapons do damage, all stats in general are completely backwards.. this game is merely a shell of what it used to be thanks to the autistic, greedy developers.",0
sniper elite is my first sniper elite franchise game.and i liked sniper elite positive .gameplay is good .co-op is so fun .long story mode .graphic negative .multiplayer .story is so bad .the same missions,1
"while, of course, many people may praise for this game for depicting the life and tragic story of an 'ordinary hero', this game doesn't have the atmosphere, or the solid story behind it. it doesn't show the hardships of life, doesn't show the grey area of every decision. doesn't even come close to the ingeniuity of games like papers, please. the best thing about this game is the ending screen. and the fact that you can get it within minutes from starting it. didn't finish it, nor want to finish it. this game doesn't even deserve a proper review, let alone the name. it's boring and pointless. simple as that.",0
newest update completely broke the game. don't invest your time into this game.,0
best moment in this game was when i found out you can ask the overseer for cram. i collect cram.,1
"it's a really good just time waster you run in the background. i havn't put a dime into the game, and have gotten at least the value of a few giggles out of flavor text, refrences, and just checking on it once or twice a day.",1

such a fun game can't stop playing it must get game play single player or co-op doesn't matter which you play still one of the best game i've ever played.,1
"although this game is fun, it's a complete diablo clone. seriously guys! diablo graphics with diablo gameplay, something everybody wants, right? honestly i thought this game would be amazing. but with so much repetitiveness and boredom this game gave me, i can't recommend it. who knows, this game could be amazing once you get into it, but after playing for a few hours and still not 'getting into it' it really doesn't impress me. graphics however, are on par and this game does have some charming elements. out of .",0
"highly recommended game for tennis lovers! maybe a price around - would be ideal. still the game is great. some polishing still needed- gt as mentioned by other reviewers , when slamming the racket fast the ball passes through it.",1
i dont really get it. sucked pretty bad.,0
i enjoyed it for what i played. it reminded me of war thunder or star conflict.. but on boats! and not made by russians. and it had nice artwork on the loading screens. and the voice actor for the tutorial sounds like someone i know.,1
"great game with good replayablilty. while the graphics aren't the best, the price is cheap, the gameplay is addicting, and it is a fun game in general. the game itself will last a while, with plenty of side missions to keep you occupied. it's a nice game to sit back and enjoy.",1
"if you're new to this or just got this for pc but played on consoles, mod this game with dx fix on nexus mods. that combined with hd textures its over. turn off aa and blur on the menu, also put it on window mode it you get screen tear, and after enable borderless fullscreen on dx fix menu. after mess with the dx fix menu for aa and oclusion, turn off the intro for faster menu starting time. unlock fps, put , , , or depending witch works best for you, it works with the borderless fullscreen option. trust me, you're gonna see this game in a new light, make sure to back up your dark souls folder just in case you want to mess with other mods.",1

"l strong attack, are you serious? what other game requires pushing w space to simply jump? why would someone even release such a horrible port to pc? i mean ffviii is a bad port, but this takes it to a completely new level. verdict if you are a mouse and keyboard gamer to the bone, don't, please, don't try it, you can't usee stuff like this.",0
short but creepy. has good atmosphere and ending. no problems with gameplay.,1
"firstly let me start by saying that i absolutely love the bioshock series. now, after playing this, it's really soured me on the series. this is a blatant cash in, because instead of working on a sequel or another entry in the series, k games have basically thrown the original games at a poor 'studio' to try and turn over some quick money. seriously don't bother. a very poor pc port once again, and in all honesty, other than a couple of ui improvements, there is nothing to distinguish this from the original. the worst part are the bugs. there are completely random ctd's, and other graphical glitches. pretty much every bug that existed in the original is present in this. you don't mind the bugs so much, but random ctd's that lose a couple of hours of gameplay? those aren't forgiveable.",0
"alan wake is a very nice horror game adventure type game. i don't wanna get into details too much and ruin the story. you play as the famous author alan wake. he decides that he needs time away from being bothered by many of his rampant fans. him and his wife go to a small town called brightsprings where they plan to vacation at. throughout the game alan starts to notice things are going strange thoughout their trip. if you have a decent computer that can handle the beautiful graphics and you are looking for a horror adventure game i recommend you take a look at alan wake when it goes on sale. personally in my opinion after playing through the game, i rate it . out of because the game has a interesting story line along with beautiful graphics and combat, however the game does not attract me to play it over again for a long time.",1
this game wont even run,0
"challenging game. for its price, the playthrough is worth it. the concept that the more time you spend on a level, the harder it gets is something i haven't played in a while. it forces you to keep moving lest you be overwhelmed. in this regard you get a good rush to do your best. my only complaint is that you don't stop to smell the roses.",1
it has a lot of potential but right now it is just really frustrating. i spend more time searching for games than actually playing. when i do play its buggy and half the games have extreme lag. it's sad to see a game that has so much potential be so poorly handled. i would not buy the game in its current state.,0

bad graphics. you need ages for weapon.,0
really good just a few more bug fixes and it will be the best software yet,1
"too focussed on getting the next patch out that fixes other stuff and neglects small things, like the people who can't get it to fire up at all! i don't want 'workarounds' either. it's a released game on steam. fix it. i want my money back. i don't care how good the game is for the slected few that can play it. make it playable, then fix the bugs.",0
"i was sold that this would be a similar experience to the bg series of the s. saw screenshots, dev updates, and pre-ordered. hype train. got to play it the other day and was disappointed by the experience overall. the game engine seems dated, blurry, with a poorly designed interface. the character creation experience is boring and not remotely as engaging as an rpg should be. clicking around the world felt clunky and non-responsive. that said, it's the first game i successfully returned to steam and it was incredibly easy. what a turd this game is for the price point - and in general.",0

"a game pretending to be much smarter than it actually is, l.a. noire soon becomes repetitive and stale with neverending q amp a sessions, illogical outcomes of those interrogations and rockstar's patented awful gunplay sequences. the game also suffers from tacky and poorly designed add-ons like the annoying rockstar social club and incredibly lazy porting from an obvious console game to a stuttery mess on the pc.",0

great game still needs work but for a dollar its worth it,1
"while stealth is pretty much the only thing fun about this game, it's pretty dull and boring. the ai can hear see through the walls. dull and lame zombie style waves that feel the same. very little diversity of enemies. way to much dlc. have to follow steam group for severl few items.",0

"a charming characterful shooter that ultimately feels lifeless and lackluster. weapons largely feel dull and unvaried, and lack of any discernable power progression turns combat into a slog. dungeons are large, but drops are sparse making exploration feel unrewarding. couple with gates requiring special keys that don't drop, and one gets the sense the game is resentful of being played. ui is stylized but hampering, to the point where it is quicker to alt-f and quickstart rather than sit through the slew of animations that play on character death.",0
"wow, i had really forgotten how boring these kind of games were. all the tedious micro management and villagers standing idle a pixel away from their work and soldiers running for the wood for no apparent reason. maybe this was ok when one was young and had all the time in the world but now it all just felt like a waste of game time. sure, all games are a waste of time in some way but this was a boring waste of time. and that is the worst kind. graphics update was disappointing and texture mods only helped a little. still felt like playing an old game and not in a good way. glad i bought it on sale and only wasted a little money.",0
"if you enjoy half an hour of pointlessly running around the forest looking for the wraith which keeps warping away while spamming decoys, then waiting until seconds before the match timer runs out before actually fighting you, you'll love this game. otherwise you're better off with something like left dead where you actually get to kill things.",0
"i really enjoyed playing this.. interactive visual novel thing. you interact with the ai on an abandoned starship to find out what happened to it. it was a little hard to get into--all the korean names and dates scared me. but once i got into it discovering the story was really fun! there's even a part where you get to feel like a hacker - . if you want to try out the style of game to see if you like it, try playing the free digital a love story",1

"this game is initially fun, but eventually you will realize that to truly master the game you must spend a ludicrous amount of time playing the game. the game is not strictly pay-to-win, but you will need to exercise good diplomacy and teamwork in order to overcome payed players and you will have to work hard. but again, the whole process is ridiculously time-consuming. have a job? a family? other games to play? steer clear.",0

"ace of spades was a great game..was. the classic ctf is still here and is one of the few good gamemodes in this game. the vip and territory control gamemodes are the only other good gamemodes, and not even they justify the purchase. any class-based gamemodes are a complete waste of time. the classes are extremely unbalanced and the marksman class is obviously the strongest. the game doesn't even seem to know what it wants to be. it shows elements of tf and cod cod negatives, that is and jagex, like everything they touch, ruined the game. there is a moderately entertaining zombie gamemode, but again, there isnt enough here to justify the purchase for any price. dont buy it! go to www.buildandshoot.com to play the classic ace of spades for free! do not waste your money!",0
i really love the artwork in this game and for the most part the platforming gameplay. the developers have done a great job of the game itself. but.. it really sucks that this game requires that you register and login to another steam-like ui. i purchase games on steam because i want to play them within steam's ecosystem it is really disappointing that this game goes against the grain and tries to bring along an entirely different system. almost everytime i go to run this game the other launcher ui asks me to sign in and i can never remember the password that i came up with for that account and end up not bothering to play it. it is for this reason alone that i cannot recommend the game.,0
"to be honest, it's an awful console port yeah, the game is great, but there is a lot of bugs. u need to take your drums and start dancing to make it works. even after all your drums magic it works not well, some video futures better to switch off at all. it's the shame of netherrealm if u want to buy it do it only during a sale. do not pay the full price for pc version. and finally, where is all people online? nobody. i've tried every solution from the internet. i think i'm alone in the university according to this game.",0

"i did enjoy the game at first, playing a lot with my friend. but after some time hours or so i became bored with this game. but any chance of me returning to this game went away with the introduction of microtransactions. i hate microtransactions they made a promise that they would never do it and they did it anyway! so dont buy this game, we need to punish this crap company",0

"one of those games that you reinstall everytime someone starts a discussion about it. get the unofficial patch before you play the game otherwise you'll encounter bugs that will bog down your experience. the game has a rich lore regarding the white wolf universe. each clan is fun to play and have their own strength and weakness but the ones that stand out and feel like it's a totally different game are the malkavian and gangrel. it has great atmosphere, music , characters and story. the combat in the game isn't that great but what i mentioned earlier makes up for it.",1

warhammer k. a game with a rich history and historic battles. this game let's you be one of those marines that you command on the ground. i've heard about the series for years. but i've never had a chance to experience the ultramarines until now. i'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to simply destroy everything in your path in the most satisfying way possible. it's you against entire hoards. gotta love those odds. that's where you call upon the will of the emperor and tear the scourge to shreds in holy fury. this is a great start to get into the war hammer k series. i recommend it,1
"max payne is, without a doubt, one of the absolute classics. ranging from bullet time to its brilliant graphic novel cutscenes, absolutely gripping, grim story and nice selection of weapons, this game has just about everything you might want in a game. despite its severly outdated graphics, it's still so much fun to play and really recommendable!",1

"fez is clearly a love letter to old-school side-scrolling platformers like super mario and metroid. it's -bit aesthetics and sound are distinctive and charming, and the gameplay is incredibly therapeutic. playing fez isn't stressful at all, which is in line with creator phil fish's vision for a game that harkens back to children just playing and exploring without any clear objective. the rotation mechanic is a very creative addition to spice up the gameplay of traditional platformers. the ending is pretty remarkable in that it makes references to string theory and physics. awesome game!",1
"while at first glance it might appear to get repetitive quickly, i found that payday was a really enjoyable experience. the missions never play out the same way twice and are all varied enough to keep the game feeling fresh. the rpg-like skill trees add a powerful sense of progression that truly make you feel as if you are specializing and getting more powerful. payday also features the most responsive and invigorating gunplay that i have experienced in any game. i would tirelessly recommend this game to any of my friends, especially if it is on sale.",1
this game is a pretty cool physics engine with almost limitless possibilities and permutations but i can't in good faith give this a thumbs up for reasons. everyone says the entire point of the game is that there is no goal or purpose and you can do whatever you want and use your imagination or whatever and that's all great except that there are literally no objectives. like it's fun sticking balloons on zombies and watching them fly away and setting up cool scenarios but it gets old. the absolute worst online community of any game i've ever played including call of duty and league. every single online mode you ever play has the most obnoxious year olds you can imagine who will sexually harass you if you're a woman or cuss at you in their prepubescent voice if you're anyone else.,0

resident evil review in words no pause button,0
"not a bad game but it gets boring after a little while. one thing i didn't like was that you can't truly start over unless you swap worlds. while the persitence is nice it makes it hard for new comers to really feel like they can be part of the society. lastly, while the worlds seem highly populated the game doesn't appear to be actively played. i presumed that most people were 'setting it and forgetting it' and moving on to more exciting games.",1
"i was appealed by the theme and the beautiful graphics. while they're still absolutely stunning and gorgeous, i decided to stop playing this game. utterly disappointing. - very convoluted controls. it's really like playing a console game. one button does many things, convoluted menus, uncontrolled movements, very unnuanced. - complete lack of freedom. the game is extremely linear with no customization for your character, let alone the path you're taking. - very slow plodding along of the storyline. it bores you to death. - combat goes from ridiculously easy hacking away enemies without breaking a sweat to inexplicably difficult with four enemies beating the living daylights out of you without you even knowing what happened. extremely not recommended.",0
"first off thank you for adding jnpr to the game, i would like to see more of the characters from other teams added in the future but for now i am just glad i can play as nora and break some legs.",1
"i would like to recommend this game, but sadly it is just a bunch of grinding for better gear if you look at it from a broad perspective. not to mention after the servers were down for about a day or they handed out compensation that i did not recieve nor did several of my friends despite being effected by the servers being down. poor customer service, grinding for hours and hours, and in game purchases with real money make this a negative review",0

"recommended with qualifications - i'm a sucker for this sort of gameplay, and snowblind's baldur's gate dark alliance is one of my favorite games of all time. this game is sort of more of the same, but feels very rote. it's super linear, with no sense of exploration, but the combat is tight if simple and the loot grind is satisfying. the game makes a pretty half- attempt to serve tolkien fans, with cameos by members of the fellowship and other lotr characters, but the dialogue is terrible, with much of it amounting to little 'middle earth wiki entries,' and the feel of the game is far more d amp d than it is tolkien.",1
"while the open world and the possibilities are nice, the gameplay and the visuals are absolute grabge. even though it is from , it still looks awful even at max settings. the 'gameplay' is terrible and vats makes it too easy. it's like bullet time on crack. i give it a . out of and say only buy it if under",0
this game has one of the best transitions into the steam market it runs smooth. it has the right amount of free to play with out it becoming about how much money someone spends a large amount of different items to craft it may not be a game for everyone but for those who perfer crafting and trading over pure bloodshed this might be for you,1
"minecraft is only sex, pvp and dubstep -comunidad espa ola de minecraft",1
"i know this is old-bone, but this game is nothing it's predecessors were. too arcady, made for the masses, no thinking involved, way too fast paced battles, you aren't able to enjoy the guys fighting it down there, as you were in previous games, way too much 'pro-micro' needed, trying to make it more competitive on the battlefield. annoying, and building an empire is not at all rewarding, with all the 'new' fixes and patches, is just became less irritating, tho still no separate unit movements on the map, no family tree etc. yes, the game improved a lot on other terms, but i just find it repetitive and boring after turns, also, the of dlc factions are lame, ea stlye. and then attila ? come again ? great, now i can take over europe with horses. same engine, probably same base. not interested thanks. having the warhammer world in under their title should've made them do a proper warhammer total war game, but no. attila. have fun with it. if you want to play a good total war game, get napoleon or shogun , not to mention the previous games were awesome too medieval ii, rome .",0

absolutely terrible. save your money. buy dayz instead!,0
"this game may seem fun at first, but alike many others i have progressed to dislike this game more and more. for what seemed like years no exciting updates or stunning features were added at all. many features are broken or downright stupid, the security system in the game is clunky, the occupants of the space base either hate each other or love each other for no apparent reason. overall this is a completely failed project and you must be crazy to buy it.",0
out of for the uninstall button for this game. . this game takes forever to actually play you get no progress its too hard it shows animals in the trailer and you can barely find the animal so you can tell if you played it that they spawned them in or they played the game for hours to find animal..biggest waste of time since adventure capitalist.,0
"this game is the ultimate bad- simulator! as most say, the ultimate accomplishment in the creation of this game is the nemesis system. it's awesome how a lowly grunt can ascend the ranks and defeat me time and again..feels real good finally putting him to the sword. feel free to add me as a steam friend the vendetta mode livens up the game even more!",1

don't waste the eight dollars. even after the supposed update to fix the audio problems you still can't hear anything. if you live in the city like i do and have to compete with the constant noise of city life outside of your home you can't feasibly play this game. that's even if you have headphones on with the volume jacked up all the way. i recommend the other titles instead.,0
"this game is quite a lot of fun but i only play it when i'm just trying to relax. ok, ok, lets just cut to the chase. here are my pros and cons about the game. pros -nice graphics -the easy difficulty is easy -no microtransactions unlike the mobile version -repetitive popping sounds you can turn this off -nice co-op setup -you can buy special agents with monkey money to help you in battle -you can't buy your way to victory -double money makes this game way better this only takes around - hours -awesome music don't get this game if you hate repetitive music or you don't like turning the music off cons -random crashes happens to mac's or rarely pc's this only happend to me once on a pc -you either have to have your sound on or off you can't adjust the volume on music or sound -the bosses are either too easy or too hard. this game is awesome for and for anyone who likes the thrill of unlocking new things to help out friends or yourself, this game is a steal! bloons td rating out of",1

"i definitely enjoyed this more than bastion. it's got a very distinct art, music and gameplay style that blends together and all compliments one another and works for the type of story its trying to tell. there's nothing wrong with bastion of course, but i did feel that game was more than a bit overhyped. transistor on the other hand remains subdued and subtle which the whole game fits into. it's a bit short is really the only downside, but that's to be expected with the price and quality.",1
"it might have been complete once, but after trying it, it isn't too bad for such a cheap game. think killing floor, except really, really stupid and with giant enemies and vehicles. the hate for this game is a little bit ridiculous at this point, so i suggest getting it once it's on sale and just have some fun. with a more polished sequel with more content and variety it might actually be a great game.. hell, give me a sequel with climbing mechanics from dragon's dogma and we have a classic.",1

"way too short. not much explanation on how to play, but easy enough to figure out. mainly just insanely short for what is supposed to be an in depth rpg. you literally have one main mission, and a few side quests. gameplay is also somewhat lacking, and once you finish the campaign in about hours , do not count on any replayability. thank christ it was on sale for like ., but the regular price was . lol. what a rip off.",0
"it's got good storyline, but not much more. there's no control over the main character, fighting is like a bad pun - you want to avoid it at all cost. worst of all is the graphics - the intros and teasers painted the picture of this cutscene like graphics, but the game features no such thing. bland colors, repetitive models and low poly buildings is what i took out of the game.",0
played this game and this game might be the worst i have ever played do not get this game it is crap! the screen shots lie,0

"ok game, but overrated. i like the assassin's creed batman combat style, but damn. this game got repetitive and burned me out in a hurry. everything is just . the story is pretty flat as well, and isn't enough to carry the game. so it is leaning on the combat, and like i said, gets old way too fast. i can't recommend this game unless you can get it very, very cheap.",0

"first off, i'd like to say that it is odd that steam removed the original from the steam store without removing the dlc as well. this game, like the metro redux, expanded the original to be better played by modern pcs, which i think the originals didn't do very well. as the original last light was removed, i am unable to give first hand experience of the changes to the original game, but i must say that playing the original metro , a lot has changed in general. for the price, i still think it is a better option than the original, but i recommend grabbing it if it is on sale, because grabbing both reduxs for . was the best decision i have made in a while. the combat is very good, the functionality of the menus is very responsive, and it runs pretty good on my intel centrino laptop. also, you can get a lapdance for rounds!",1

"the game is not suitable for use with the game controller but works fine with a steering wheel. i connected the wheel and finally i get a nice progression in the game without special effort. i do not know how realistic the game, but what is certain is that the steering is very fun and easy. so after i started playing with the steering wheel, i can easily recommend only playing with the steering wheel.",1
"definitely one of my favorite free games. fantastic, unforgetable, and just plain awesomeness. puzzles weren't too hard, and the style of the game is just so.. vibrant and luminous. when i finished the game i was just so satisfied and i really wanted to play again choosing different choices. i was sad to see the bad feedback. definitely install to your library.",1

"at the time of this review i havent even finished the game. this game is dark and distinctly different from the first but is still a masterpeice, especialy with the new achievments and the expansion that has been added through the steam workshop. this game is a must have.",1

i do not recomend this game the graphics are terrible and physics too its pretty laggy and boring,0
such good potential - but poorly made,0
"i really wanted to like this game, but playing it is just making me wish i was playing tlc instead. the scenery feels a little darker than it's tlc counterpart, not to my taste, but the character faces are hideous by today's standards, especially the hero and maze.",0
"the style of the game is really cute and the premise is interesting, but it was so fast-paced that i could not get sucked into the stories or the characters. i restarted the story different times and just felt rushed throughout the entire beginning. this may have been what the creators were shooting for, but it did not feel like it was executed effectively not a terrible concept, but personally did not do it for me",0
"took me back a few years, worth it just for that. ever frustrating with a keyboard though i suspect it's really meant to be played with a controller maybe there should be a 'controller suggested' instead of 'controller supported'",1
"this game is a ton of fun. simple, challenging and addictive. but for a game that emphasises co-operative play the online is tremendously laggy. when i play with more than two people at a time one person always seems to freeze up, lag out or just disconnect. the same situation with different hosts i often find it difficult to make it through the first level without a hitch. although still fun to play alone, its much more enjoyable with a couple friends. but due to the connection issues it can get frustrating when someone disconnects after a half hour of gameplay with no saves or any way of reconnecting.",0
amazing if u like on stuff ull love it,1

"well.. it has good graphics, not that you can turn them on without fps despite crysis running like warm butter on this machine. it's still extremely buggy months after releasing. if you liked the first rome, you'll be better off just playing that. i highly regret buying this and even more so for preordering.",0

"have you ever wanted to be a beta tester for a broken game without all the hassle of being paid for it? good news, magic duels origins is the game for you. it crashes to desktop on computers that destroy the requirements and loads fine on pos laptops that don't meet them. it disconnects you from the server for no reason and tells you that it won't save anything you do from that point on even the single player stuff . oh, and for no reason the music volume will jump to , so that you can blow out your eardrums while being terrified of a sudden loud noise without having to make stops. seriously. assassin's creed unity at least has the excuse of being a complicated world with different animations, textures, ai, and gameplay elements to load all at once not a good excuse but at least it can be seen as a reason for all the bugs . this is a card game. no excuse for why this was released in this state.",0

this game owns so hard. be a cipher and commit brain crimes.,1
"telltale really surprised me with this game. after i was able to get into the game, having had to deal with some technical issues surrounding the game, i thought it was pretty damn good. the game itself blends a lot of cutscene and story with decisions you have to make. a lot of decisions are not cut and dry and the game doesn't tell you exactly what each choice implies and you are left to decide which option is the best. the only part which i did not enjoy was mashing the e and q keys at times. if you like game of thrones the tv show or the book, you'll love the telltale games adaptation.",1
nothing makes sense in this game.. but hey you are a goat..,1
"not nearly as good as i had hoped or even expected. oh well. it was still fun, just not what i wanted it to be. i wish there was a 'neutral' option in the reviews. i'll give it a yes, it is well done after all.",1
"i loved these games as a kid! i grew up with them and the nostalgia and memories i thought were worth it.. oh and steam trading cards.. but i cannot recommend this. anyone who uses emulators knows they've just thrown these on steam using an emulation system. the game is laggy, sound is laggy and its an early basic game. the fact that this game runs better on an emulator and rom version of it i downloaded both for free is severely disappointing. and its not my pc, if i can run high graphic games like eso, tesv and tf with limited issues, a simple game like this should not lag! buy only at a discount.. or not at all.. or maybe just for the cards.. so disappointed i cant play this properly. 'what could possibly go wrong?' lt -- everything!",0
amazing visual novel in which the player gets to simulate staying in the friend zone. the player has no agency whatsoever aa he enters the on rails rollercoaster ride and experience the firsthand weakness of being a beta. this review ends like this amazing journey with me typing goodbye.,0

"i thought this game was going to suck. i hated the old games. this game blew me the away. i pre ordered watch dogs. i got frustrated with it, and decied to try this game out for a bit. i bought it a few weeks before, and installed it and never played it becuase i thought it was going to suck and man oh man, was this the best surprise i could have ever had for a video game. i loved it. easily worthy of being a uncharted competion. an amzing game, with amazing graphics, and even more so, an amazing story, with great gameplay and lots of stuff to explore and unlock. just a masterpeive that i was not expecting.",1

"in regards to this review, i'm not a proper critic and do not base your opinion on this review. being a longtime fan of sid meier's civilization series sid meier s civilization vi did not disappoint. this title in the series has probably played the best and renewed my enjoyment in the series. it brings me back to sid meier s civilization iv where it improved upon every aspect of its predecessor and i had alot of fun and enjoyment with iv and like iv sid meier s civilization v did that same thing an improvement of engine gameplay and etc but with v came alot of unpleasent bugs that took years to get it to the mostly playable state that it is in now. what is different about vi that distinguishes it from its predecessors and why do i think its entitled to being the best of the series? pros",1
"at first i got this game as a joke, i was positive it was gonna suck. but after i played it for a while, i found myself lost in a beautiful masterpiece of a compelling storyline, amazing visuals, and a harsh competitive feel. i fell in love immediately. even though i've only played this game for about an hour, im in love, im planning on playing this game for hours. i will be the best, highly recommended.",1
"inside offers up a rich and dark blend of science fiction, in a believable near future apocalypic dystopia the protagonist to this follow up to limbo is also a child, but a very unsual one - with hidden talents you begin to take control of as survival demands it. a chilling atmosphere at times, lifted up with darkly humerous puzzles, as you travel through neatly sewn together locations on this journey you will experience some of gamings finest moments.",1

"'normal' is a difficulty that should make the player try hard on their first try, and be an ok-ish breeze on their nd try. 'easy' should be a game where the player can win despite making flawed choices and mistakes. your game 'easy' hard for other games. it's so hard that it makes me not want to play recommend this game to anyone else. it's so difficult it makes the game repulsive. you've got good ideas, but poorly executed.",0
great game! have had so much fun playing this game!,1
"followup game to payday , rob banks, steal drugs and gems. shoot cops, try to get away with all your loot.. what more can you ask for in a co-op fps. loads of hidden things more options.. just yum that was my first impression, and the game is good for a diversion.. the issue is there is so much dlc now for the game that the price is almost x the base price just to have access to everything.. really kind of discourages people who play it casual grab it and its dlc on sale and you may get your moneys worth.. but not really going to recommend it now with its insane amount of dlc",0

"this game is quirky, and you'll get a couple of laughs potentially if you play it with friends. which is ultimately what my review continues to reference. however, the choices, ultimately, are not yours. when the writer wants you to make a certain decision, an options such like this might appear . will be ever be the same? . goodbye. . goodbye. choosing one, will still result in goodbye, but you'll watch your character delete the message. this is the illusion of choice, which is an illusion of gameplay. it simply leaves you 'going along the motions' which is the worst kind of gameplay experience you can have. it is free. if you want it to be worth it, play it with friends and mock the insufferable emily, whom is so awful anyway, you will not want anything more than to sabotage your relationship with her. not recommended, but if you feel compelled, play it with people.",0
wonderful game. takes me back to when i played myst.,1
"the game is good. its one of the best games i ever played. but this hd remake has little to offer other than steam surport and easier multiplayer than the original non-hd version. it actully lacks the originals expansions! the old game can be modded to just as good hd as this and with the expansions. the old has more maps. players has made way more custom maps for the non-hd version. only a few maps can be imported to the hd version exactly because the lack of expansions.. and the old game is far cheaper than this.. in short, no. this game is not worth it over the non-hd version. dont buy this until the expansions comes if they come.",0

"not worth the time to play. unable to play multiplayer with more than , buggy iron, ridiculously unbalanced. castle building has gotten less complex since the original crusader games and there is just nothing unique. the game is slow boring and horribly optimized. stronghold crusader and legends were my childhood but this game does nothing to stand up to their standards.",0

this game is too good.,1
"i don't usually play mmo's, but when i do, it is definitely the secret world. basically, it is more like a single sroty-driven game, which is even more fun when playing with other players. the setting and plot are gorgeous, i would tell more, but don't want to spoil anything. if you like conspiracy theories, h.p. lovecraft, stephen king, post-modern literature and urban legends and would like to play an immersive mmom than you should check this out. the secret world is different from other multiplayer rpg's. p.s. there is no stupid grinding in tsw, which is a sickness for most mmo games.",1

"i had to make up a whole new word just to describe this game, said word being 'gorious'. 'gore' and 'glorious' mashed together. because that is what it is. it's gorious. in all seriousness now, this is possibly one of the most fun, gory and action packed games i've ever had the pleasure of playing. there is a story but it's not the main focus. this game's main focus is one thing and one thing only shooting the everloving hell hehe out of everything that moves using a variety of immensely fun-to-use guns, and an amazingly fun-to-use chainsaw. the blood, the gore, the explosions, everything about this game works together to create something that cannot be described with any word other than awesome.",1

"this game is horrible, do yourself a favor and dont buy it. as kid i loved the original n and n , but i must have been blinded by my younger selfs limited mind. the gameplay is the same as the original except with more 'enemies'. the gameplay is not fun, there is no skill involved, all you need to beat it is pacience to power through the levels that mostly consist of waiting till the enemies and or stage hazards go away. after that happens you have to get used to the horrible floaty and slipery controls. there is no satisfaction from anything you do in the game since it barely feels like in your in control. the only good thing about the game is the music, which is ripped straight from soundcloud.",0
"did i enjoy this game? yes. is it worth it? no. i bought this game as a part of flash sale for the summer sale. in one day, keep in mind, i was getting constant it bluescreened my pc four times. the fourth, after rebooting my pc again, i got a message from uplay 'it seems that your saved data for this game isn't on the cloud. what would you like to use for your save game?' my nine hours of data were wiped, and every time i try to relaunch the game and get the progress back, the game blackscreens after i click 'new game'. don't go through this torture. don't waste your money on watch dogs.",0

"one of the most memorable games you will ever play. if you need a reason to buy it, despite overwhemingly positive reviews, just know that everything about this game is amazing. the artwork is beautiful, the music is beautiful, the storyline is..you guessed it, beautiful. the choice making system keeps you on the edge of your seat. it also makes the game feel realistic. in real life, you would only have a split second to make a choice, and this game does a good job of making you believe in it. of course, now the little mermaid is ruined for me. but that's another point entirely. basically, buy this game. i would tell you more if i could, but these lips are sealed.",1

"basic summary - planes are hard to fly, snipers are hard to find, c can and will ruin your entire day. pros - great selection of weapons - you do not need to p w points finger at ghost recon as all essential items can be bought relatively quickly - outstandingly polite and informative community spanned across numerous outfits that are always willing to help you - unique and spectacular usage of combined arms, tank divisions, fighter wings, mass infantry rushes etc etc - excellent gameplay that you will not get bored of cons - lag is seriously detrimental, and quite common. to counter this, turn off shadows in graphics, it helps alot - new players, your breaking into this game is going to result in a few hundred deaths without gaining anything",1

"i understand that this game is designed to be 'silly' and 'glitchy on purpose' but quite frankly the novely of 'haha im an goat i can lick things' runs out within the first few minutes of playing. it's advertised as 'a break for the seriousness of modern gaming', and it does that well- that is to say, it's so over the top and ridiculous that it's annoying and frustrating. the whole 'glitches a lot to be funny' feels like a gimic, and gets old before you even get to properly enjoy the game itself. for , it's a ripoff. don't waste your money on a novelty.",0
"this game goes to show that advanced graphics and crazy set-peices are not required to make a fantastic gaming experience. using the most simplified graphics and interface you will see in a modern game, thomas was alone brilliantly tells a story about a computer ai who is looking for friends. it is a platform puzzler that tests your brain, but isn't so difficult it will melt your mind. the soundtrack and narration are absolutely wonderful. this game deserves to be played..so do it! on the yeti scale of brilliance. highly recommeded.",1

although the game doesnt seem bad certain elements like lack of content and the inability to change servers in case you picked the wrong one. only is realle na. thier is no team name delete and the names are used across the whole game. so if you make a mistake in the name or the server and its a name you favor your pretty much screwed. they expect you to pay to change the name of the one you no longer want so that you can use it on another server.. beware!,0
"her story is a game that is very different from the conventional video games that most of us have been playing all our lives. even though this game offers a point of view that is refreshingly different from the rest, it will probably only cater to those who are die-hard puzzle game fans. wait - in fact, there's really not much puzzle in this game. i didn't even know what i was doing, watching endless videos after videos of interview dialogue, and expecting to find clues. boy, was a disappointed. but meh, this game only cost me a few bucks so i'll let it slide.",0
"okay d platformer, very very similar to the metal slug series, i thought the game was hard even on lower difficulties, it is - hours if you're good at it, or about - if you're average. worth it for the couple of bucks it was at the holiday sale.",1
"the game has a very intriguing premise, and while being extremely visually pleasing, it wasn't all that enjoyable. the narrative was great, but it just lacked a certain punch i was expecting of the creator. i don't reccomend the game, but if you're looking for a short bittersweet story, and have the cash to burn, then i'd say give it a whirl. there's definetely worse games out there.",0

"i was not very happy with this game. i've played a few story driven games before, and while this did have a much better story than most of them, in the end it just kind of fell flat. it was pretty predictable the entire way, and the end didn't actually explain a large part of the mystery. i would recommend watching someone play this game over actually playing it yourself. the game makes you think that the choices you make actually impact the story, but they really don't. the choices you make only determine what is said in a few conversations. overall it was a good story and the graphics were pretty nice, but i would watch rather than play",0
"storyline i felt like some of the later moments in the game reminded me of far cry . like you're drugged or crazy, you hear voices and you are walking down a constantly changing path. besides that good thing, then the story line is good decent. i also felt like it was quite short gameplay tons of loading screens, especially when you're going in and out of windows, and it didn't feel like open world at all. there are certain spots you can't climb on, and mostly that is rooves. it is that feeling of not touching the ground that i seek, which the game did not bring. the two factors are definitely a deal breaker for me. i will maybe buy the next game if it becomes more open, instead of being in 'mulitple sections', where you have to load to get through the map.",0
"lauched as a buggy mess, and now has been abandoned by the developers less then a year after release while the console versions will continue to recieve new dlc and patches . there's really nothing else to say about it after learning that.",0
does not launch at all. can't even see the splash screen.,0
"i don't know if either it was that i couldn't find the correct key, or the locked door had a glitch, but i wasn't able to complete the game. there is also a glitch with the menu screen once the game has already started where the restart level option isn't as responsive. as far as my taste in horror games go, it wasn't quite my cup of tea, but i did jump at one jumpscare. i also wish there was more consitency with introduced game mechanics. like if i'm going to be able to open stuff up, don't just make it a feature, incorporate it more into the gameplay. or when you introduce an objective, follow through with it instead of distracting the players with more objectives that lead to different levels for no reason. if anyone is interested, i've made a let's play that shows a portion of what the game is like",0
"if you're not a fan of rpg games i don't recommend this to ya i started the game and the music felt really awesome! i checked the options to see if the resolution is right and graphics aren't too low. i saw the d option! it's amazing if you don't have eye problems. i started the game. i chose a viking to play. talked with the brother and my first fight. for the first time it felt awesome, but then it got boring. reading, reading, reading and reading again. c'mon, civilization even has that lots of text, but it's more interesting! i really didn't like the game. it felt too much as heroes v. boring.. out of",0

"what can i say, game's pretty good. prepare to put a lot of hours into it if you are going to play it seriously. bosses can be very difficult if you're not prepared and the game can get repetitive, however it's still pretty fun. would most definitely recommend it for a sandbox game.",1

"as someone that only invested time on the campaign, i can say it's passable. the shooting mechanics feel tight, but you'll get that on pretty much any other fps game out there. the story is alright, you have a despicable villain with a revenge plot and a hero determined to stop him for killing his father just like one of my japanese animes , but it's nothing that spectacular. the thing that really came off as good were the side missions inside the game, where you get to organize different squads and drones to fulfill different objectives. these side missions brought some fresh air to the campaign, which is just an a to b shooting gallery filled with the ocational confusing obstacle. the multiplayer, which i just played like minutes of, is alright. i don't see why anyone would buy this game now, but it's definitely better than ghosts. i give it a out of . you can find better shooters out there, the whole tactical side-ops thing you can achieve far better with other strategic military games, like x-com or arma iii.",0

"with so many mobas out there. which one is the best? well i can't answer that question for you, but i can tell you how great this game is. first off, this game has a steep learning curve, so if you prefer mindless action games, then this isn't for you. once you get past the learning curve however, that's when things start to get really fun. dive in to this action packed game as you battle other people across lanes in a team based enviroment. there is literally next to no grinding in this game, everyone starts at level in each game, so the only real question is, how far are you willing to go to become the best? watch other people play with in the in-built game viewer, and study a libary of heroes as you progressively become better. don't worry about people calling you a noob when you first play, because they were also noobs once! just ignore them and enjoy the rest of the game.",1

great little top down arcade racer which reminds me of my childhood days playing skidmarks on the amiga. you can usually pick this game up cheap and it is fun with nice looking tracks. the only downside is it doesn't have online at the time of writing. it didn't bother me but some find this a major downside as some of the games competitiors do have this feature.,1

"although i enjoyed this game, the game neglects to tell you there is no present autosave feature, therefore as my game unexpectedly crashed, i lost hours of gameplay and am being forced to start all over, that is a beyond huge disappointment, and i am likely to never launch again due to the fact. another downside, is the fact enemies can critical hit you in full cover from across the map, while your agents have trouble hitting a target feet away.",0

"this is a great fighting game that is simply not well optimized for pc. high voltage has consistently failed to patch properly and communicate, often causing more headaches any time they actually change anything. what certaintly should be the definitive version is held back by a terrible port. the game itself is great, but it is simply more worth if you buy it on ps . i am ashamed of high voltage, netherrealm, and wb. i have enjoyed the game itself, but the hassles with the port have soured what should have been an amazing experience.",0
"brilliant game that's irrepairably marred by a broken online system. you might think you're in the clear once you get through the slow and convoluted web of installtions and sign-in's you need to start the game up for the first time, but even after hours of gameplay there's the very real possiblity that dark souls will simply stop working. i need to make myself perfeclty clear here, i don't mean the 'crashed and then restarted' kind of stopped working, i mean the 'tried to start up one day and couldn't even get to the loading screen' kind of stopped working. even so much as saving your game requires you to be constantly connected to the poorly conceived 'games for windows live', a service that has been completely discontinued by virtue of its overwhelming iness, leaving you with a broken game that can only be fixed by accessing features locked behind microsoft's drm, and with the only official support resource that might be able to help you being completely disbanded. if you have any other means of playing this game, i can reccomend it strongly, it's a brilliant game, but for the love of god do not get it for pc.",0

"this is probably one of the absolute best games to come out last year. if it wasn't for the witcher and konami being s, this game would absolutely take the throne. it has extreme amount of content to it and is otherwise very well crafted. the optimization is so good it makes me every time i see big boss in the chopper at fps. goddammit i can't run anything on even stable frames and this thing of beauty goes smooth as butter even in the most detailed situation. otherwise, it's quite that they cut the ending and a lot of missions, and a crap-ton of things that were planned but didn't make aboard. damn konami, man. if you're looking to buy it and you're new to the franchise, i'd recommend beating mgs first. it's not on pc but it will tell you most of the story that you need to know aside from peace walker and ground zeroes and it's anotherwise a one big feels trip. all i can say about this game is that it's pretty good.",1
"when it comes to the rogue like genre my first experience was with the game binding of isaac which really put me off to the genre as a whole because of its unforgiving difficulty and lack of empowerment plus i simply was no good . so when i was given the chance to try risk of rain, i pretty much had negative preassumptions going into it but the moment i said to myself and to my friend who i was playing with 'one more run', that's when i realized that it's hooks sank in and i was captivated. faced with the looming threat of rising difficulty, i appreciate the need to balance one's time between farming and moving forward within the levels. really it's addictive aspect is that with each run you have the possibility of being a force of nature within the game from all the perks buffs one can receive and it's really satisfying to jump into horde and just have at it. the fact that there are different classes allows for varied gameplay and the background music was a joy to listen to. still hesistant about roguelikes? after playing some of this, your answer will be no.",1
"wow! a real hidden gem! it looks like a old game with -bit style graphics, but it'a actually a really kewl idea that i hope gets a sequel! cause thats the only thing about this game the left feeling lacking - the length. it was kinda short. but other than that it had a great puzzle system. i would recomend ths game to everyone. however i would wait to catch it on sale. bucks seems kinda steep for such a short game.",1

"another brilliant game from blendo games. the art style is simple but attractive, and the core gameplay is great. i found it a bit portal-esque, in that some of the puzzles stopped me up for a little while, but it was never terribly frustrating and i always felt clever when i solved it. i also really liked the cyberpunk-in-the- s style of all the interfaces, and the little story interludes between missions were great. very atmospheric and evocative when they needed to be.",1
"i think that this game is one of my favourite indie fps games out there. the game has a counter strike global offensive feeling to it with battle feild graphics. also, the limited hub, no hit-markers, freindly fire, and smooth graphics make the game seem realistic. the only thing baout the game that i don't like is how op the frickin bombs are. like jesus christ, if your atleast feet away from a c it will kill you. but, i love the game, i recommend this game to any one who likes games ike arma and counter strike, this is for you.",1

there is a lot of bad comments about transport fevers signal system which they compare to open ttd which i would like to clarify a bit. the complain is that a train always goes to the assigned platform and does not 'smart' pick a free platform. which is possible in ttd with proper use of ttd's signal system. the reason that this can not be done in transport fever is because transport fever leans highly to be a simulation game. the goods that should be pickup are on that platform. if the train comes in on another free platform than all the goods needs to be moved which would be really time consuming. it is pretty rare that happens in real life.,1

beat hazard is the most awesome music-based game that i have played. i recommend it to everyone who likes music and shooting crap in space! the music affects the game in a great way and varies the gameplay a lot. i really like how it's not only the tempo or volume but also the intensity of the song that changes the feeling of the game. you can easily feel this when you play songs from musicals in this game. i do not in any way think that this game gets boring when a song gets quiet or slow which i think that a lot of other music-based games do.,1
"i know that i haven't played that much of his game, but i do thoroghly enjoy this game. although the 'story', for say, is a bit confusing, i loved the musical aspect of the game. it's just so simplistic and easy to understand, yet diverse enough to create great jams.",1
"i really wanted to like this game, but i couldn't. the art and the music are great, but the game itself felt like a chore. i'm not someone who expects excitement every second i like slow-paced games, but this one.. to be blunt, it just felt like a waste of time. it's not relaxing and a nice change of pace, like i expected, just tedious and irritating. perhaps that's the point and it's a metaphor for motherhood. i'm glad a lot of people were able to enjoy it, but sadly the bad outweighed the good for me. i recommend giving it a pass.",0
not a bad game !,1
"really strong game, unlike anything i have played before. very much a story game, but incredibly impactful all the same. the only tacit criticism i could levy against it is the play time, which will probably be around - hours on your first playthrough. honestly though it's not much of an issue since the game packs so much in that time. i'm really looking forward to playing it again and see how things might change. i would strongly recommend this to anyone that enjoys games and is looking for something completely original and unique.",1
"this was a refreshing game. not much of a 'game', but a way to use this medium as a storytelling device. some of the mechanics were clunky and sometimes were more of nuisance than anything else. don't let it get in the way of trying this game. it's money well spend. just know hour playtime, almost no mechanics, beautiful touching story.",1

"best online racing experience. done by their matchmaking ranking punnish point system. not any other game can offer this. however i like this game to be eu style. there is also a lot usa cars tracks in this, what is good in general, but you will notice this us style also for road races. kinda cups cars etc. however you could drive gt formula renault formula . and there are a lot of official tracks in this. remind this you gotta pay to drive by year for example you gotta buy cars and tracks. these are unlocked forever, but you cannot login into your account after subscription has end, till you renew it.",1

"looks great. but looks can be deceiving. this game biggest strength, is also its biggest weakness its theme. fighting in a realistic post-apocalyptic version of the most iconic modern city in the world, new york well, manahtten more specifically , is breath-taking. kudos to the enviroment team, you guys did your job. but, unfortunately, that means that enemy variety really, really sucks. you fight the same guys over and over and over again. and worst of all, the content is bland and seriously lacking anything memorable. wait a year for all the dlc which is was pulled from the main game, by the way to come out and then it might be worth it. the division doesn't know what to do with itself at end-game. the game design is seriously lacking repetition, repetition, repetition and don't get me started on the 'pvp' area known as the dark zone. i've spent hours in it and have never even been accidently shot by another player. at least you tried ubisoft, but i've played and will be spending what little free time i have playing better games.",0

"samurai, ninjas, the joys of watching horses slam into a wall of peasants holding pointed sticks which then in turn are slammed by a wall of gatling gun bullets.. the counter artillery barrage from your cannons falls short and lands on the enemy generals head, ensuring your place standing atop the piled dead in an instant as what's left of the enemy runs for dear life while your calvalry cut them down for experience. chaos is a wonderful thing in pc gaming, i applaud the limitless mass carnage regimental combat has to offer and the unequaled brutal eyecandy that has you so enthralled you don't even notice your tea has been poisoned with nightshade. treacherous demon wench geishas are not to be trusted.",1

"this game is awesome. combat mechanics are handled very well, requiring some tactical discernment and gives battles meaning beyond a pretty animation like in the civilzation series - or you can just skip the battles to keep it short. the concept of ruling the galaxy by each star system feels like a novel concept maybe because i haven't played a ton of x . and when you have so many star systems it becomes too much to keep track of, you can just tell the computer ai governors to keep track of them for you. better yet, you can tell the governors what to focus on - monetary improvements? military? food? the game in short is awesome. i haven't played a lot, but over the summer i would spend long hours through the night and extending into the early morning playing this game. and while it has been a while since i've played it's not because i got bored some steam sales caught my attention - i'm sure somebody can sympathize . great game and a nice addition to any x collection.",1

"still worth playing, even after all these years, even if you played oblivion and skyrim first. and that isn't nostalgia talking, because i literally did not get this until i'd become bored with skyrim. you'll want a few mods if you've got a decent system, and want graphical improvements, but it plays pretty well out of the box anyway. still has an active modding community, even though a few major websites have died in the past few years. not a perfect game by any means, but the most creative one bethesda ever made.",1
"well where to start. at this stage the game is nigh on unplayable. the pathing for mobs are imposible, the connection freezes and combat stops, and elements become uninteractable. the ui is waaay to cluttered, and it is next to impossible to find where things are. the unlocking of the elements as you progress is a good thing, but there is next to no description or explanation about how to access these elements. basically, this game seems to still be in alpha stage, and at this stage has no right being released to the public. all the creatures within the tutorial stage have waay too much health for the damage that your character does, which with the afforementioned lack of actual explanation with the introduction to the game systems leaves you wondering what you are doing in the game.",0
"its a good game, its very immersive and the gore is simply amazing. the story line is alright. the mechanics are generally sound and they're good. i have a very strong consious and my issue with this game is that i'm punished because of this! i just want to horde supplies in a little community and solve out problems, all the while building a kick sanctum from the apocalypse outside our walls, but noo! this game wants me to go all about the city rescuing hopeless people from a few zeds. and thats not something thats wrong with the game, thats a plus! i would like a gamemode or dlc.. or something where your little community is literally it, once they're gone, game over. no more people around the city and no crys for help which i feel bad for ignoring, just us, surviving.",1

"i love long drawn out civ games with a passion. but this 'rip' of civ didn't tickle my pickle and is not worth my nickle. i assumed that gameplay would mix space and planets together and you would be able to play off two maps. that would be super cool and what i thought was happening with the accountment of this game. but the gameplay is still centered on one world map and i saw that same copper skin from civ . its weird on my second game that i would choose french civ and ui would speak disappointing english back to me, not french. i bring this up from my first game, when the french ai civ surprised me with spoken french on my first game. that's cool and same with the other civ's. but still this game was disappointing experience, hard to micro-control your economy, set up a good one city challenge, weak customization of units, a race for affinity points, and alittle more.. i would give this game a 'downright darius' out of 'pizza but' -dunkey",0
"not worth your , way too many microtransactions i do not recommend this game out of",0
"this one was supposed to be a gritty military shooter with a twist - you need to make hard moral choices. truth is, you don't have much of a choice here, people will die anyway, and i suppose this was a whole idea of the game. i don't like it, its like they are trying to justify any sin and atrocity that happened at war, simply because it is a war and soldiers do not have any choice. i find this idea just plain wrong, everyone has a choice, even if this choice is to die yourself. only the inhuman crap like former ss personnel and war criminals from later wars try to justify the unspeakable things they have done by the fact they were given 'an order'. speaking of the 'game' itself, there is a scene with civilians, including women and children, burned alive, that is why i won't recommend it to anyone.",0
moar fun to god of fun!,1
adding dlcs frequetly is ok as long as they are good ones. paid skins that affect weapon stats and gameplay are worse idea.,0

"the game is very fun and an older cod that brings back memories.. but the multiplayer system is hacked. i would have about hours right now.. but i just wasted my money buying a game that doesn't have multiplayer. if you are in a lobby with hackers, you'll most likely get banned. i could go on but this isn't worth it.",0
"h on the original but this, is not a remastered , poor performance. unplayable.",0
pretty ok not to good at all like everybody says. maybe even overrated,1
"installed this game, came in my character creation, the skin was all black couldnt change it, tried the small training, couldnt use my mouse, or any other key for that matter, and to top it all, at the beginning there was a sound tone that was so high i litterally had a headache for a few hours, not a single information on how to solve it anywhere.. so all in all a good solid game !",0

"it's been a year and a half since this game was release back in ea. ignoring my many playhours, here's why you should play the game! perks the survivalist still sucks imo, it's only a better cmd successor of kf updated graphics better gore! new bosses! community noobs ruining suicidal hoe games needing to carry everyone on sui hoe games as everyone's an idiot doing the same thing over and over again! there's plently of players playing vs! cool guns! so are you still undecide whether to get the game? well, get it only if you have a bunch of friends to play it with. that and when it's on offer.",0
"awesome game, worth to be called a final fantasy.",1
i only downloaded this game because i of my picture..,0
clicker heros is a good clicker game and a good way to get your trigger finger working and killing monsters at the same time and i also like how it plays while your gone even with the game closed so i recommend this game! out of,1
"so, here's my take on it overall, it's a fun game, for one run-through, if you need something to play in short bursts. there's a bit of frustration in the beginning until you start getting some upgrades under your belt, at which point you can start to survive more than thirty seconds in the castle. however the plot falls a little flat, which wouldn't be a concern if they had just left it out, because let's face it, you don't really need plot in a roguelike. but since they took the time to give us journals and clues and a cohesive storyline, why make it so pointless in the end? when the boss asks why you're attacking him, i don't actually have an answer. however the game expects a much higher uptake of skill than i necessarily experienced. i'm not a n b by any stretch, but apparently i'm not hardcore enough for this. as soon as i tried the new game , i saw that the enemies had gotten exponentially harder and equally unfun to deal with. so if you're looking for long-term play this is only fun if you like frustration.",0
"this game has given me hours of fun and in my opinion is one of the best games out there even until this day- contains everything you need, action, amazing physics, humour and an amazing story line!! out of worth it!",1
"i loved hf and really wanted to like this game, but i was very dissapointed. very few servers had players and the two i did try were dominated by pros who decimated new players. within minutes, i was so fustrated by the one-sided battles that it stopped being fun. honestly, if you dont mind dying a lot and rarely making a kill, the guns and maps are fun gt however, for most players, it will be aggrevating. trust me, go tf instead.",0

after taking so long to download this game in excitement kept saying retry file is missing or something and all that time for nothing and installing it now once again now have to wait another long wait i played this game at a friends on ps and it is addictive and fun many different things to do i recommend it but this game takes away sooooo muchhh memory its insane,1

game breaking bugs that were present in closed beta test are still present in the game. why even do a beta? a bunch of quests are broken and some of them even in the main story line so you can't proceed any further with the quests. wow. good job guys. get your together.,0
"while i definitlly recomend that everyone should get this game, i was extremely dissapointed that i was completley finished with the game in hours. in a singleplayer story only game, the campaign should last much longer, or allow you to explore areas you had been to before. this game would have been greatly improved with at least a singleplayer challenge mode, so thst you could still play around with everything you had unlocked. i really hope they add a multiplayer patch. out of for story and gameplay, out of for length, out of for gamemodes, out of overall",1
its a good game for everyone but awsome for minecraft fans,1
it is not bad but my relationship with moba genre is terrible.,1
a game that you have just as much fun playing as you know the dev did making. kind of great.,1
the game is fun but i have some bugs when i go to a snow area my computer stuck and i have to restart my computer but in regular areas its fine and i have a lot of missions in the snow area and i want to finish them and its doesn't make any sense because my computer runs the game on fps.anyways i hope u will fix this bug but for now i don't recommend this game,0
want diablo for free?? download this!,1
"i got this one on a steam sale. i found the story very captivating and the voice acting superb. yeah, it's a short game. i went through it in hours and i was taking it very slow. considering that i've paid more for a movie, i certainly got my money's worth here.",1

"one of the buggiest, most unoptomized games i have ever played. if you can manage to play this, or the 'hard life' without constant bugs, crashing, freezing, etc. then yes, it can indeed be fun. its a fun game, but due to the constant crashing, i have to give it a thumbs down. save your game every seconds becase it will crash very frequently",0

you should buy fallout new vegas instead fallout,0
love this game has great combat physics and levolution effect the lighting is better than wow's and the gameplay is times more fps the gtx ti,1
i can almost understand something now,1
"story was absolutely ridiculous, but enjoyable the game is already years old, but has aged well open-world manhattan is a blast to stomp around in free-roam your mutations powers are well-varied and the game is absolutely bursting with upgrades and unlocks being able to imitate other npcs can be fun, especially when consuming base commanders and taking over military strongholds you can hijack military vehicles, which can help break up the monotany of your typical mindless killing sprees voice-acting was surprisingly well-done, especially that of the main antagonist - visuals and character models were lacking, even taking into account that the game came out in - stolen weapons ie. rifles had horrible mechanics and felt forced the game may as well not have introduced it - your character moves like an idiot when holding a weapon of which there are only two types, ugh",1
imagine a game made entierly of ice levels..,0
it's ok but everyone's camping,1
just dont buy this game. very rushed and has less content than 'star wars battlefront'. you will regret buying this,0
"excellent. simple to play, but very well done and involving. shame the source is a graphic novel, and not massively overpriced otherwise i would buy that too. highly recommended - though perhaps i would have waited for all of the episodes to be released so i could play them all through in one hit",1

i cant get in the game for some reason but when i was able to play it it was realy fun,1
you guys should buy this game,1
without spending money you can't shoot of the animals you'll find and finding any animal at all is just an annoying chore. watch a few gameplay videos then decide if you want to spend money on the game to play it before you make the mistake of thinking there's something nice to experience for free here.,0
"one of the coolest games i've seen. great balance of strategy and real time, not to mention the awesome puzzles. i personally love the mechanics of it and just how the game feels and plays. stressful in those certain fights, but super natural to play. at first some of the directional controls seem weird, but it starts to make sense once you start dealing with bigger baddies. really it is spot on for fans of fantasy. and you can play a different game every time with the character stat-choice and development.",1
"story line is boring and the action is far too predictible. weapons, both in the story mode and the multiplayer mod are so hideously underpowered, an airsoft gun could kill a person faster. the multiplayer mod is what really makes this game worth it and the mod is free , but the campaign just sucks.",0
"this game is surprisingly good for how early in the beta it is. it's music needs more variation though, i have only heard one combat song, and i think two planet songs, with one ambiant song for on ships. the art is obviously done by a skilled pixel artist. the combat can get repetetive and annoying. exploration and construction i find are the most fun parts, i've even already planned out a whole civilization for when the save wipes end. content reaches quite far, advanced apex labs and avian skyships are some examples. any content that isn't ingame you can probably find on the site's mod section, and if it doesn't exist, the modding is so easy that you can basically rule it, only instead of porn, it's mods. i made a doge mod to see how really moddable it is. not a complex mod, but one nonetheless. edit steam badge",1
"in my groups opinion we rate a . out of . it is a very good fps game that most everyone should own. as it is free, and the owners are not on a limitless budget, this game is one of the best free fps's on here. pros good lan connection. good online connection. great graphics. limited space. little hackers. all around fun. free. cons -make the first person mode more obvious. -different guns. -more updates. -add a place to donate. i would recomend this game.",1
"great game and is scary considering you are a year old kid, but it makes me remember the little stuff in my house growing up that looked scary at night, lol. the story line is crazy too, i was not expecting it at all.",1
"update - dont be fooled! they changed their games name over a bs reason falsified that there was potential lawsuit action because of the movie 'world war z' but in reality it was so they could continue scamming other people into buying their mess of a product. name changed from 'warz' to 'infestation survivor stories' -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i.. do not recommend this piece of s game! do not buy it! plagued by a terrible developement team, unreasonable random bans they will say you are hacking just by simply picking something up , their user data bases are constantly comprimised, they lie to the consumer and falsely advertise right to your face! lastly, this game is still in beta even though its not advertised as one lt --- oh look false advertising!",0

"i played the game for a few hours and it's just like the developers said. the graphics are amazing, the concept it's a really good one and for those that say the game is not like they expected, they are wrong. they didn't understand the purpose of the game. i really recommend the game if you like exploring because this is what you do the most in this game, you explore. i admit that i'm a little dissapointed because it's not really a multiplayer game and you can't meet other players even if you try, but that doesn't mean that the game is boring. thumbs up!",1

"nothing even works in this game, joining servers included its also really boring",0
minutes after i started playing i couldnt click on anything except settings. so after another minutes of going full screen - windowed and back i gave up. i did play the game some years ago with no internet connection and it was focused on single player and it was great. i would love to play the game but since the only command available is 'setttings' is kinda hard to enjoy anything,0

"really fun game. at first i was skeptical on the game i bought it cause it was a dollar and it looked interesting. but as i played i got hooked. this is honestly one of the most fun games i've played to date. the gorey executions, the stealth system. it's fun. but be prepared to rage because you get killed in one hit. the only problem is that i don't think it has a lot of replayability, even with the masks and weapons you have to unlock. other than that this game is a must get!",1

"hot japanese school girl wearing a short skirt with katana in her hands! is this heaven? this game is so awesome. i love it. the game is short, but worth replaying. this game is pure action, so you cut duft punk enemies and mechas down. the main character and her friend are so beautiful and sexy. there are also a few different outfits school outfit, priestess outfit and more . there are a lot of pantsu shots so your dingis will be also happy. the music isn't my style, so i didn't really enjoyed it. that girl really knows how to wield a katana. the fighting system is simple and easy to use. i also like that the character is very fast and athletic. one of the best hack amp slash games.",1

"this basic control gameplay concept should never have made it out of the prototype phase. you can only shoot in the direction your car is facing, which means you can either drive where you want or shoot where you need to never both. as you are constantly being attacked by enemies pulling alongside you, the experience of the game is one of irritation as you are forced to point your vehicle every which way but where the road turns, swerving left and right like a drunken lunatic forever waving at flies. pressure doesn't challenge you it harrasses you. this is simply the least amount of fun i've ever had driving a car mounted with a machine gun.",0

"in the current state of things, tharsis is just not enjoyable. a high difficulty combined with a punitive rng system just makes the game way, way too hard to be enjoyed. often, your dice pool is incredibly low after your second turn and you end up with ridiculous situations where you just want to give up. for example, you must repair a module with a total of points. that wouldn't be so bad, but said module also has stasis on dices, void on s and injury on . so you constantly lose your best rolls, get stuck with unhelpful dices you can't re-roll and if you're very unlucky, you'll roll a bunch of s that will kill your crew mates. i don't want to imagine what hard mode is like, really. this isn't an isolated occurence, it keeps happening over and over when you reach turn . while the game is simple enough in term of mechanics and the visuals, as well as the cutscene help setting the tone, this game will need a lot of fine tuning before it can shine properly.",0
"buggy as all hell. it refused to let me finish one mission as there was an enemy stuck in the sand and my troops would not fire on it. all saves from that level had the same bug so i tried going back and completing the previous level again first, this time the game refused to unlock the strike planes duing the mission and wouldn't progress for no apparent reason. the art direction is nice and the movable base element is a nice touch but the bugs ruined it for me.",0

"honestly one of the best games i've played this year. fun and addicting dungeon runner, with rpg elements. in the beginning you'll probably suck and die alot, but as you progress and upgrade skills you'll get stronger and stronger, and be able to take on epic bosses which give you all sorts of goodies when defeated. you can also buy gear and upgrade runes to alter your characters stats. there are also various mini games to be found all over the world, rewarding you with gold if you complete them. there is also a legacy system in place, which is quite neat. when you die instead of having to reload your game, you will play as one of your descendants, who will have unique characteristics he might be a dwarf, be colorblind, or have irratable boul syndrome etc. etc. . haven't seen anything like this in any other game, and honestly its quite cool. all in all a definite out of ! if you don't have it yet, what are you waiting for!? o",1

"the game itself was a work of art. i found myself being drawn to the characters, wishing to know not just more about their pasts but also their own personalities. everlasting summer was well made and really had me attached, the only downside is that it needed more interactions with specific characters. although we are aware of the main paths we can take, at times i just wish characters like miku were given more scenes or to say screen time.",1
the end is soo xd,0
i play this game months geus what happend error now i am sicks i hate steam i hate errors i hate this site,0
the game will not run at all for me i have tried all help from the forums and they could not help me with my problem so it will stay uninstalled until the game can run,0

ing love this game its amazing i love exploring and not to long ago i hit hardcore mode on my world the bosses weapons armour and tools textures are amazing and for only around dollars less than minecraft its better than most freebuild games ing out of would play again,1
"tired of action rpgs like diablo ? me too. this is much better -- rogan approved. tons of skill customization makes each character unique and individual unless you're a little who can't be creative . dark, gritty atmosphere with brutal combat and explosions. who doesn't like explosions? play this game because it's free and has explosions.",1
collision mechanics are very annoying. little street racers is much more fun.,0
"amazing game! the graphics are great, the audio is great, gameplay is great, plot is great..",1
"knights of the old republic has not aged well at all. the environments are left empty and feel 'small.' the menus are unintuitive and really show their age. pc port-over seems fairly lazy and the game would be better played on a controller. the dialogue detracts from any progress made from a good story so you're left annoyingly trotting around an unfamiliar world with little to detract from how old the game is. even for a die-hard star wars fan, it was hard to trudge through.",0
"car handling is the worst i've ever experienced for pc. i can't stand how the character is slightly off center, it makes all movement feel really weird. i really wish i could get my money back. i don't recommend this to anyone.",0

"don't download or buy final fantasy from steam. buy it from their website. . steam doesn't keep final fantasy's version up-to-date, so if you go to verify integrity of game cache, it'll always give you the error 'failed to vailidate files, will be reacquired' or some t along those lines. . if you try to play it with the outdated . version that steam fails to keep up-to-date, it will still prompt you to re-download it, even though this is what.. my fourth day now? don't buy this game over steam. steam doesn't deserve final fantasy's money for a game steam refuses to keep up-to-date. tl dr, don't get this game from steam, they're lazy s that don't keep up-to-date, get it from ffxiv's website.",0
"visually stunning but not nearly as good as the free half life mod that it was derived from. combat is clunky, the community is garbage, maps aren't as good, and the customization options still aren't remotely good enough to redeem any of the other negatives. not as god awful as war of the roses but definitely not as good as the original age of chivarly mod. i'm being extremely generous giving this game a out of . age of chivalry was a free mod. this game is just a cheap piece of cash in.",0
"i - k, gtx , gb ram, graphics on lowest quality, result? fps in campaign with drops of fps. i would recommend this game, for my opinion it's a great cod but, that optimization is awful. do not buy this game if you have worse pc than mine.",0
"good story, but it's too black and white. there is no grey area when making choices.",0
"this game is just downright terrible, they changed the name from war z to 'investation survival stories', nice trick. it is buggy as all hell and there is barely anyone playing. you may buy some ammo for real money then get chomped on by a zombie,losing everything. ok that happens in other games but in other games you can retrieve those items, not in this one. it is boring the audio is and there is no premiss or fun. this game gets a out of ..hang on..thats to nice..it gets a out of thanks for reading and don't buy this game!!",0
the joke is this game is a bit crap. if you're after a quick laugh watching a goat ragdoll across a map can provide though!,1
"one of my favorite games ever, monaco is a cooperative game that is fun to just watch your carefully laid plans fall apart just by one careless misstep. i recommend everyone try this game at least once, especially if you like stealth games. years later and i still go back to this game, pocketwatch made a real gem here, please give it a try.",1
"complete , i got onto a server and then it crashed and i was never able to play multiplayer again. buy this game if u want it to get hacked. complete waste of money",0
game wont run for me and i have no idea why i tried uninstall and reinstall and it crashes right when i start a new game,0
years from now we'll look back at the styles of the times and wonder why anyone thought it was a good idea to use dubstep for anything.,0
love this game a quick play through takes around - hours wish steam would put other lotr on here those are great to but nevermind anyone that hasnt played this game they should its a total different storyline to the other lotr lol guess you can tell that by the name haha but yeah out of,1
"this game, despite being a 'rhythm' game, does not reward any use of rhythm- in fact, it's almost completely trial-and-error, plus it only has a few songs in it that you'll be hearing the entire time. in addition to this, the game appears to be inconsistent with certain rules such as what constitutes an 'obstacle'. not only that, but the graphical style and motion blur of the first world somehow managed to nauseate or give headaches and eye strain to nearly everyone who observed me playing this game- it's a literal eyesore. i've heard decent things about its sequel, but this game is rife with problems.",0
awsome game ! - full licence to trucks - big open world - open for mods - beauty graphic - radio option -tuning !!,1
"did the free to play for the weekend.. could be an amazing game, but their are a few flaws. gameplay is waaay to slow, i can only take so much of watching vehicles explode and enemies move across the whole screen to kill me in one hit. oh yea, even on easy the game is way to hard. the movement and views are awkward and frustrating. im not sure why i cant just have free camera roam? other than that, amazing game! the concept is great, love the base building feature, great story. the game was just super frustrating.",0
show your middle finger to enemies for cheers up. ooo . ooo,1
"this game has absolutely incredible unit ai and the factions are interestingly balanced, the devs are also actually actively balancing the game and doing updates! so that's always a plus, all in all this is my favourite game for now and i actively look forward to seeing how it is in years time",1
really challenging and incredibly fun. highly recommend this game.,1
you can play local computer.it sucks,0
it has good music and flappy goat. out of,1
"that game is simply trash, repetitive as hell, boring gameplay, lame attempt to look retro but in the end only look . the 'game' if i may call this a game even crashed when i entered the th level. oh and it's also really easy, kinda for a 'roguelike' right ?",0
my room is bigger than this game maps!,0
"this game is all about the 'emergent' gameplay. it's got a sandbox feel which let's you create your own stories of honor and courage, but more likely underhanded scheming and murder. for example in order to gain the kingdom of france, i married by sister to the nobody that was set to become the king. after they had a few children i had him assassinated. after that i had to marry my son to my sisters daugther inorder to press her claim for the throne of france against my nephew. familyfirst",1
loved it out of great game great story all around great game if you havent bought it yet do it now!! if you are a cod portel fan you will love this game get it now!! then u will want to get half life as soon as it is out get this game now!!,1
"found a cool trick with this game buy a copy of far cry buy a second copy of far cry for your so for co-op campaign update direct x and uplay login to uplay fail to have uplay recognize your game copy restart login to uplay again and enter the code watch your so do all the above steps, then create a uplay account watch your so's uplay account creation fail for no discernible reason.. 'try again later' try again later try again later again watch uplay ban your ip address for multiple attempts write your first negative review on steam join the legion of apparently very justified uplay haters",0
"doesn't support two controllers. supports one controller and a keyboard. bought game to play with friends, so didn't even bother beyond menu since we couldn't both use controllers.",0
"very fun game, and i always like games and situations where everyone works together to do something, and that's what this game is about",1
"barely runs at all fps or worse, massive pop-in, constant loading on a computer that ran railworks and gta just fine. completely useless.",0
"i more or less love everything about this game. it's got all that i want in an indie rpg retro-styled graphics, sentimental music, interesting plot, and great characters aswell as script. definitely worth a try in my book, if you like indie rpgs. i fell in love with it instantly!",1
"this little minute experience made me giggle with its own special kind of humour, and i expected nothing less from the creators of stanley parable. if your someone who hasn't yet experienced the wonderful stanley parable, and the demo left you unsure about whether or not you would enjoy it, give this little gem a go, and you'll see exactly what kind of ridiculousness you would find in the stanley parable, amongst other things, but that is for you to find out for yourself.",1
this 'game' is pointless. apparently it's a satire. i got it in a humble bundle. never buy it.,0
"alright, a little disclaimer first. i'm not gonna bash on h amp g. it's a pretty decent game however later i'll discuss why i wouldn't recommend it. positive aspects of h amp g 'free' great visuals for a non- a title. good customisation. decent gameplay so here are the negative - perfomance and bad graphical customisation - weird ui and menus most important for me - really focuses on in-game purchases. it's really difficult to unlock certain weapons and it'll take you a lot of time. therefore there is a payment system which i don't think is worth it.",0
its like csgo but free and little bit worse,1
"good graphics, and so far a pretty good character building system. see the opportunity to play it a number of different ways. been going pretty solid warrior big surprise i know , but the lure to dual class is pretty strong.",1
"we, at gotgaming , have made a full let's play series on this game. the last episode will release tomorrow. it took a while, but we finally beat the game. our last episode has our final words and opinions of the game. enjoy",0
"everything about this abomination was already said, the pure and only purpose of this 'review' is only to lower this.. thing ratings on steam. it's sad that things like that make it to the shop. it's another example that quality control in valve doesn't exist. my 'time in 'game'' needed to beat it was around minutes. i got it for free, i will use im to get cards and then i will hide this thing in darkest corner of my library and hopefully forget about it. if you consider buying it, do it only on sale with discount, to make a profit on cards. but you shouldn't because this will gave 'dev' some money and this might encourage him to create more abominatiations.",0
failure is punishing. victory is satifying. awfully fun. awfully rich. enemy unknown can keep you busy for h . enemy within brings you more. multiply the former by if you decide to take up long war. a game for a lifetme.,1
"this game sucks. i played half a hour and now i want to refund it, but guess what?! it said i played hours so now i cant refund so i lost euros.please give me my money back! this is robbery!",0
"at first it worked and it was fun, now it does not work, no matter what i do..thanks",0
"the villain is great, it's too bad that mass effect isn't on steam. choices made from one game can be important in the next, so i would check first to ensure that playing it via steam will allow you to have those choices carry on to the third which needs to be played via origin",1
awesome game i would play times!,1
"i tried this game, but it's nothing special for me.there is a lot more intersting games on steam or generally. but it was free so i don't have to regret spending money. got a free copy of the game from orlygift.com",0
"such a shame, game is not as it was adertised. i hae played hours worth of this game and i won't be able to get them back",0
this game will kill call of duty better than battlefield ever will.,0
"this game is fun,and weird girls kissing cool graphics and its kinda short but fun.",1
"very atmospheric and fun point amp click adventure, with lovely art and cute characters. if you liked machinarium, this one will definitely not disappoint.",1
i bought this because of the indie movie and the guy said if he didnt finish it he would have killed himself it honestly is not that good,0
"i actually have more than . hours, it's more like about hours, anyway, this is an awesome game but i stopped playing because it kept crashing all the time. it's sad, but i will probably come back whenever they finally fix all the bugs, etc. i love the character building as there is no limits to the amount of skills you can create mix.",0
"if you like stealth games you will like styx. it s not too demanding for your computer so you could be able to play it in a decent laptop, or a medium pc. check specs. it has something that resembles thief and dishonored, but this one is more centered about stealth than those, so the combat is not great. its recomendable if you like to sneak in payday or stealth all the way through in outlast. controls are fine, they are made for you to be active, not the game playing for you. so you will need some time to get the dynamics but its fun. just fine, not a masterpiece, but a enjoyable one at a competitive price.",1
"sort of hard to get started, but once you get past all the learning and find a few heroes you like, it's really fun.",1
i bought this game and a day later after being finished downloaded i click play and starts and then it only shows the ac logo on the screen and nothing happens and it stays there like its stuck and i cant exit it out. i guess ill buy this on xbox one next time since its not working on my computer.,0
"this is by far my favorite resident evil. i was a big fan of the original on playstation one, but this version just takes the cake. definitely a must own bow",1
"the game seems like a pale and soulless rip off of smac the factions are bland, the units are bland what few there are , microing trade convoys is irritating as sin, there is no narrative as in smac part of why i replayed smac for years is the immersive narrative presented through the wonder movies, tech and facility quotes , the aliens are barbarians had krakens sit under an orbital laser for turns . was incredibly stoked for this game, and found it to be a dismal let down dumbed down even beyond what civ was at launch.",0
"good formula and a pretty fun game. at this point i would not reccomend due to various gameplay bugs glitches the game that put the game into unfair frustration. imagine an enemy clipping into a wall making you unable to shoot it, yet it can still shoot at you. will change review once the game is fixed.",0
"got this game and start up and everything was off, and my intial thought is if i go to the settings it will fix everyting because it setip for my computer. i was totally wrong, the in game cut sceen were fine but when it cam to hte gameplay all the cars squeezed and resemble a tiny clown cars you mighty see on tv. tinkering with all setting didn't fix the problem and immediately requested a refund",0
i got this games and a day after i got it elite horizons came out and i spend on this and horizons was for special nice!!,0
whys it feel so stiff d while the zombies maps felt so smooth idk the online play was a nightmare to me!!,0
"amazingly good, reminds me of sorcery on the amstrad, but way better because it's so random and replayable. the only worthwhile action roguelike i've played, and i've played a few.",1
it's dota. c'mon. dota. nah but it's aight,1
i got sucked into it for minutes after i bought it then forgot about it! the music is great!,1
its a really fun game but it keeps crashing,0
with the exclusion of this most recent entry the duels games were about teaching new players how to play magic through the use of fun and often powerful decks. this is a game about playing a bad draft deck built around perilous myr vs a similar quality draft deck built around perilous myr. wait until the card pools expands.,0
very nice little interactive story. lots of feels at some parts.,1
excellent graphics and great story plot. love the twist and little suprises here and there. took some amount of time mastering the keys but once mastered it is whole new level of experience. i bought the previous versions after completed the game. highly recommened.,1
i think this game is just brilliant. stop reading reviews and get it already.,1
so i is like sorta not getting how this should play gud in win ish.,1
"not even worth it for the trading cards. i mean yes you come out on top wise, but you'll gradually lose bits of your soul just knowing you have it as a deleted game in your library.",0

confusing. too difficult. not enough ammo.,0

"kotor is an incredible game. the story is incredible and the characters are well written. to be honest i didn't expect much from the game, even with the constant suggestions from family and friends alike but i was pleasantly surprised. the only gripe i had with the game and the only thing i would warn is that you truly need to pay attention to the tutorial for the combat, considering that it's extremely confusing at first.",1
its the worst!! game i ever played!!its real bulls !!,0
"a fun little game with a catchy soundtrack. for , definitely worth it.",1
"a friend gifted me this because we enjoy memes. it's very bland gameplay-wise in my opinion. pros -graphics art - the pixel style is quality and appealing -achievements - i enjoyed the references -gimmicks - the odd things you can do in the menus are fun cons -controls - there is one button and you can't even control how high you jump -gameplay - bland, you don't even need to click to jump if banana peels line up enough while on the buildings for what it is, a 'casual runner', it probably does well. i didn't really enjoy it much though, and i wouldn't say it 'heals the heart'. i can't say i'm a fan of the 'lift girls skirts' thing either, it's out of place and unnecessary, to say the least.",0
"'you've been arrested, game over'. no idea of why. game is ununderstandable. devs put a ton if secret conditions to anything which make things impossible to foresee. lost bucks.",0
"have been playing this game for a long time, sadly not on steam, but it's a great game. what so ever, it could do more giveaways, but its great stll.",1
tags real time strategy game dev was up to some shenanigans re-releasing this game dlc as an entire new title. results this is now made obsolete by planetary annihilation titans deleting and removing local files waited a while to get the new game at dlc price.. i had paid pretty good money for this game and it has been devalued so hard it is kind of sad to see.,0

made no sense of the game play.,0
this game is awesome !!,1

it was good until they added microtransactions. do not buy this game. do not support these developers.,0

"crusader kings ii is a combination real-time grand strategy game and dynastic rpg set in the middle ages. you play as a dynasty of rulers, nominally trying to take over territory and secure the stability of your realm and your line of succession. in practice you're trying to get up to whatever crazy medieval hijinks suits your fancy, often by doing your best impression of a disney villain. kidnapping, assassination, seduction, drunken carousing, the crusades, and dubious definitions of 'portugal' are all fair game in your quest for fun. the game's rpg elements are what set it apart from other strategy games and give it great replay value. when your ruler goes stark raving mad and begins appointing horses to important cabinet positions, or when you try to convince your heir to shape up and stop being a lazy heretic, it's all part of the fun.",1
used to really enjoy this game. then it went pay to win on us. can't go into a lobby without 'hey do you have the xp boost weapons? no? ' you used to be a good company overkill.,0
my friend like its. so be it. i personally hate its.,1
"well.. first off, just no. what i like about the game you respawn almost instantly. what i dislike about the game everything elce. i only had to play one match of this game to know i didn't like it. i mean, being shot through walls isnt very acurate for the time period of game. or being killed as soon as i exeted the spawn area. also the lack of a tutorial of any kind that i could find ment i went into the game blind. the graphics make the ps look like a next gen console with everything turned up on one beasty pc. the game play is as follows point and shoot the other team. nothing elce. ther are game modes, but they are locked to a higher level. i'd ralther play cod with a controller that drops in and out with a ping of than have this on my pc any longer.",0

"at first i enjoyed this game. until i got permantly banned for no reason at all. now i cannot enjoy the jolly cooperation. which is why i bought the game in the first place. do not buy this game if you want it for the online play. from what it looks like, they didn't release the updates properly, and this caused hundreds of accounts to get banned. this is a warning, if you want to go ahead and buy it, go ahead. you have been warned.",0
this game is litterally the last game just with some added items and characters skins. not worth the money. only buy if you do not own the previous. also i have had connection issues online that i havent had with the previous games. the games i try and play get cancels out and i cant fight anyone with out this happnening,0
"just one more mod, and this one to, and this one.. of time modding, playing will do it again",1
"i like the game. i really do. despite the idiotic qtes seriously, that mechanic always was and still is just a lazy, lazy development. the huge number of walk by wire scenes that could have been plain old cutscenes. the enournomous number of cutscenes that are absolutely not needed. i never have been a fan of tomb raider games, but this one is fun. however what is a huge dealbreaker for me and is the reason why i do not recommend this game is headbobbing. wtf is with that. yes i do know that in real life there is such a thing. but in real life we don't notice it. it's a game not real life, stop trying to make everything realistic. you always fail. and always will fail at that. at least give us an option to turn it off. dear square enix i really enjoy your games and you are one of only two triple a publilshers whose games i still buy. please stop with lazy development, poor pc ports and idiotic 'features', such as fake realism. head bobbing isn't realistic. however lara dying long before she got anywhere past the beach campfire would have been.",0
"primal carnage extinction is one of the worst games i've played on steam in . i logged in and played very little of the game and was so suprised by the amount of insperation that was taken by other games that actually acheived the aspect of 'fun' this game ruined other dinosaur like games simply because it was so awful that i never want to even see this game again. the graphics arn't as good as they seem, the game has amazingly horrible lag spikes and it never was even enjoyable in the slightest. the game could use a serious redo and i wish i hadn't even spent . hours on it. out of , not worth the money. however, lucky for me, a friend gave me a copy so i didn't waste money on it, thank god.",0
"abe's odyssee? more like abe's oblivion. i have to be honest i bought this game with high expectations, but in the end all i got was a once wonderful franchise being on and served as a new installment. the only thing that's better in this game than the original abe is graphics. that's it. it's sad really, cause if they spent more money on level and gameplay designers and less on graphics engineers this game might have been half-decent. now this game might be for you if you fit into one of the criteria below - your definition of a challenge is making the same jump times in a row. - what you expect from a puzzle-platformer is not being able to solve puzzles but frame-perfect execution. - you like having seizures based on ridiculous graphical effects and obnoxious sound effects. otherwise, this game is just a waste of time for everyone involved. it is a waste of time for the developers. it is a waste of time for players, hell it is even a waste of time for the distributor. tl dr don't buy this piece of .",0
this is bad. really bad. the name of the game says it all.,0

"every so often you're changed by a film, or a book, or a story told to you by someone who asked of you only that you sit and listen. and, one in a hundred, or one in a thousand, a game will move you in a way other than awe or laughter. i played to the moon. it poured sadness into me. and i played thomas was alone, and it filled me with fragile optimism and hope. and i played this game, and it filled me with bleakness. bleakness, not of an external existential sort, but an internal failure to recognise the value in ones self. i can't say i enjoyed this game. i did not laugh, i did not smile, i will never replay it. but it changed me, by connecting me with a human story that at the same time was impossibly alien and terrifyingly familiar.",1
"this game is just ok but the fandom is so cancerous going near one gave my friend a tumor. its a bullet hell game disguised as an rpg. the characters are rather flat and forgetable and sometimes hateable, its more linear than mario and should have just been a text adventure or similar to a tell-tale game.",0

"all of the good design that went into monkey island , but more of it. this doesn't feel like a cash-in or a retread. it's a great game in it's own right and a fittingly absurd second act in the series. the special edition is as flawless as the remake fo the first game--excellent voice work, lovely art, hot-swapping between classic and special edition, and every detail clearly considered with care. i think this game is stronger than the first in just about every way. it's longer, it's more varied, the puzles are mostly well considered though there are a few ridiculously nonsensical stumpers, as seems to be inevitable in this genre , and behind the excellent humorous writing is a little more meat to each character's bones. it's a shame some of the other classics grim fandango? haven't received the same loving treatment. the quality of the remake is almost as impressive and enjoyable as the game itself. this is how you bring back a classic.",1
"awesome game, very fast paced and love the music and soundtrack. some awesome metal! very brutal! some of the battles, i felt the spirit of an unreal tournament massive online battle. yessss!!",1
"great story. voice acting is just as good as previous installments if not better . some fun but short dlc. controls still feel a bit 'clunky' on pc mouse keyboard , but that tends to be the norm for ports. assuming you are one of those able to run this game successfully, this is an easy recommendation to buy.",1

"such an engaging game, high pressure at times, funny at times amp the majority of other players are friendly and up for a laugh.",1
a very fun game! with multiple choises resulting in different endings this is a good game. to get all achievements you have to spend a few hours playing this game.,1
"here is my let's play playlist for day one garry's incident the verdict overall, i would say no. i played this game full through and it isn't a bad game, just a bad experience. the game is super buggy and glitches. the story line makes no sense. it just was not a good experience, very dissapointing. i would say that, since i paid for this game, that if the game was revamped and remastered, it should be that much. until this game gets an update it should be free. the crafting system i liked a bit, the interactiveness of it was interesting. it is a decent puzzle game per say, but i would not spend money on it in it's current state. am i looking forward to day two? if they read all the imput people have said about this game and fix it, then i would say yes. like i said, not a bad game, just needs to be fixed up.",0
game crashes every turn. i cant even finish a game. it's ridiculous that they released it as is. what a waste of time. i will never purchase another civ game in the future.,0
"i got the most humorous ending first and then the next ending tore my heart out this game is an absolute experience. sometimes having to go through all of the diologues over and over to get through all of the endings is tedious, but you really don't understand the amount of story and depth this game has if you don't own it. i honestly cannot think of a videogame i cried harder at hint do all of the character endings before the fulfill promise ending. trust me, the story ties together better that way",1

"update. originally i had this as a reccommend but now, i change that. the community isnt that great at all. regardless of being nice or being mean, hell talking at all somone has a smart remark. secondly the physics make no sense really half the time your sheild is hit through or guys with full metal move like they are a kenyan on speed running for the gold medal. people who seem to have 'skill' do these moves that again no person would be able to do in real life. and the people you face are genrally die hard try hards that only play this one game only. only chance you have is the rank - servers after sorry games over. just wait for games like kingdom come deliverance and such this game is like a call of duty infinite warefare. with swords and no jetpacks. this game never gets boring. i love jumping into the game ready to kill and the soft music plays in the backround as you hear the screams of people dieing from being stabbed",0
"this game is incredibly in-depth and immersive, and the ability for workshop items so early is absolutely incredible. it supports gajillionz of playing types, and everyone. everyone. would love it.",1
"i know, lets release half a game, then release the other half in monthly instalments and charge a time. wow, new guns, wow, new masks, who gives a crap?? i'm not robbing the same bank times just so i can afford a poxy rifle, how sad and meaningless do you think my life is?? thanks for wasting some of my time and money.",0
but what is life? other than a jar of mayo..,1
"i never played any of the original thief games and many reviewers said that the peopl who enjoyed this game most are those who hadn't. however i don't like buggy games that have awkward controls and boring repetitive concepts. perhaps i was expecting too much, but this game is not worth the money in my opinion.",0
this game is very fun and rewarding. i feel like everyone should play it,1
"difficult to learn.. but, the more time you invest playing, the better you become at developing strategies - this game will make you think and plan. everything you've already read is true the game is an interesting mix of rpg rts, tower defense, and roguelike. it took attempts to beat this on normal difficulty 'easy' mode and it is captivating enough that i still play it daily.",1
"creeper world is an amazing strategy game. the screenshots for the game look like garbage but as soon as you start playing you will be hooked. gameplay is king here. each level adds new, interesting mechanics that challenge you to play differently than you have in previous levels. this is a must for any strategy fans. i hope there is a sequel and it would be nice for the graphics to get a bit of a boost while keeping the original spirit of the game.",1
go back to cod this game is not for filthy casuals like you.,0
this game would be kinda good if you could ever find people to play with. also it's stupid that you lose your money when you lose the game because then there's no way to not just keep dying when the person you're playing with keeps winning. i'm glad i did no buy this game.,0
most boring assassin's creed since the first entry. and uplay freaking sucks. points deducted from hufflepuff.,0
one of the best rpg's i have played ever. real awesome story with great gameplay mechanics. a must buy!,1
pros -great optimization great graphics and fps without a hell of a pc -great plot -old characters return -awesome weapons -ammo is limited just like a real survival horror -good variety of monsters -tons and tons of replayability cons -sometimes youll end up with a ton of bullets which is not good for a survival horror -stupid ai -graphical glitches -youre better off playing with a gamepad out of this game is very underrated in my oppinion,1
has had potential but not really enough people on when i'm online,0
does not work on my new laptop. just constant crashes. not enjoying the first king arthur either. i recommend not buying these games.,0
the best game experience ever. oh my god out of . must be played.,1
i would if i could play it! it will not load up and it took me forever to download adobe air and when i did it took about minutes to load up the tutorial and then.. boom it crashed! this game has a terrible problem with loading times and crashes.,0
"i lvoed fallout and played it a lot, including the dlc and spent many years playing through lots of quest mods settlers, etc to extend its lifespan. fallout had lost me in the first few hours - perhaps it'll grow on me, but i'm still playing and enjoying skyrim, which i find to be a much better game. fallout 's story so far has been awful - really really bad, and has left me with no choices for roleplaying. why would i go and explore when i'm searching for my son? the dialogue wheel, the addition of a voiced character and the film camera during speeches are further annoying touches that take me out of the experience. maybe i'll ammend this review once i've played more if i get the time to! , then i might change it. but for the first time since morrowind, i haven't enjoyed my time in a bethesda open-world game. very sad.",0
"banner saga makes george r.r. martin's love for killing characters look like a dr. seuss book. when i reached the end, this game reeled back and punched me right in the feels, but i loved every second of it.",1

i got it on sale and even i am a bit disapointed.. the gama has potential but the way its mixed just doesnt pan out. sorry but so many more things could be better!,0
"i've seen things. horrible things. but nothing, and i mean nothing, is more terrifying than this. i would rather have to watch pluto nash and play sonic while drinking bleach and having my wrists slit than have to endure one more second of this game. it was made as a sick practical joke by the nazis to try and cause mass suicied. i am currently holding a noose while writing this review. i've never wanted to hang myself this badly ever since i played no man's sky, but now, i don't think i have any other option.",0
i am currently having problems with just getting the game to load up. i starts and then opens the file folders for the game and tells me it cant start the game.,0
it will take you a brutally long time to unlock any mechs of your own with out paying cash and all the prices are disgustingly high. this game is designed to bully you in spending tons of cash just so you can finally have fun. this would have been a better game if it had a a month subscription and let you drive whatever you wanted. the gameplay is solid but don't waste your time just go play mech warrior or something.,0
can anyone assist why this game can be such a low fps even though with a high-end graphic card? any solution to solve it?,0
the only three phrases you will ever need in this game . 'nice shot!' . 'what a save!' . 'great pass!' all which will only ever be used sarcastically.,1
out of best game ever. pc masterrace lt,1
"i highly suggest this game to anyine that isn't great at games like csgo or cod because instead of going up against other players you play against ai with online friends. there are pvp modes but the main game is against ai. this game is really highlighted as 'amazing' because it will run on almost any computer and it's thrilling expierence. i give this game . out of for its amazing game modes, speed of game and different diffuculty lvls for everyone.",1
set fire to most of africa with an rpg. out of,1
awesome fps that takes skill!,1
"would only recommend in a sale. wildly overrated from what i can see. talos principle attempts something similar, and does it more successfully imo.",0
"from the beginning, you will like the game. nice story, dreamful art. but at the end, you will find the problems. some stages are so bright that you will feel pain in your eyes. getting all achievements takes hours of playing. that wouldn't be problem, if the game wouldn't become boring. also, this game doesn't work with steam cloud. because of that, i'm playing it for the third time to get all achievements. again, and again. forever.",0
real time strategy couple with roguelike addiction levels. it's deadly.,1
"by all means a must play. nothing trying to hunt you down and kill you nothing to stress about. just a really well written story that unfolds in front of you. the dialogue and conversations are hilarious withj a really deep drama inbetween. enjoy it, along with the environment around you. plays great in uhd k!",1
"i actually didn't enjoy this second game as much as i had enjoyed the first. i like puzzling with boxes that have a finite set of surfaces, and not hunting through environments to find some forsaken area to click on. this game also focuses more on environments instead of boxes, and i just don't care much for the actual rooms. i was able to solve the first game without a single hint, but this game required me to use the hint system maybe - times, just because you get lost in a jungle of weird things that you don't know what to do. ..but it's a cheap game, even if i didn't buy it on sale. isn't much. the game ends with the developers specifically asking the player to write good steam reviews and promote the game in order to 'help them out', and that really rubs me the wrong way. ..so that settles it i'm not recommending this game. if you liked the first game, then let it end with that game.",0
out of would play again,1
"the open world on this game is anmazing, so many side quests n so many stuff do, have over k hours n still playing out of",1
"- nostalgic feeling check - a huge final fantasy with a world map check - the realisation that rpg's got nerfed out of how long they used to be since then p - hours and hours of random fight and upgrading abilitys - quite a nice conversion for such an old game. playable with both controller or mouse and kb. - no crash after - hours of gameplay nice job devs! - expectations are met. now, mind if i do a j?",1
awesome real simulator very nice stars,1
this is a game that could be made over a weekend by someone without any game-design experience. i'm pretty sure that's exactly what happened here.,0
"this game was ok, up until i got to the jumping puzzles. that combined with fairly frequent crashes when quickloading means that i will not be finishing this game, and honestly regret my purchase.",0
this game sucks so bad..,0
"poorly optimised port, broken mouse controls, runs poorly on a top spec pc with top gpu. microtransactions, pay to win, denuvo. this is too much and feels like a kick in the teeth after waiting so long.",0
dude this game gave me cancer only russian and y o play it,0
"great story, great characters, great comedy, great puzzles, great music, great voice acting, great graphics.. it's great. my all-time favourite.",1
"your pants simulator out of would again. but seriously though, i love this game. keep going back to it just for the and giggles. however if you have enough money, get the redux version, stealth is improved in that one.",1
"you play as a man who hangs himself.. look game i know that you're trying to be 'deep' and 'depressing' when really i have no reason to find it 'deep' and 'depressing'. a guy who kills a man then kills himself is not an original concept. and the fact that it was created in unity doesn't help either. atleast try something different apart from 'depressing because of a guy who died in a game that i have to cause'. you also leave alot of questions unanswered for example, who's are we playing as? who was the guy in the cage? why does the house have so many static tvs in his room? to me this is just another atempt at creating the new slender or amnesia or five nights at freddy's. if you're gonna make a game please understand how to make an environment where i can feel bad for someone.",0
"one of those jokes that gets old really fast. fun for minutes, then gets boring. out of",0
a very well done game! out of !,1
"pretty fun game. missions are interesting and feels alot like cod 's sniper mission, except the whole game is based around it. only gripe i have is the campaign length, which is around . hours. but it's fun and worth it if you buy it in a bundle or a sale.",1
great open world experience. worked well with my gaming rig and with a controller in hand. the studio that made this should make an attack on titan game. they would definitely make it feel right,1
if you are older than you will hate this game,0
hmmm what can i say about this game i can say its a decent game and has some good interest in it this is like mc if there were guns and a online multiplayer personally i think this game is a pretty good game why i am not reccomending it is because of its price paying . for it just wont do this game needs to be way less i got it on summer sale i believe and i paid around . for it and yes i think its a good game and i love everything jagex does i just dont think that this game should be the price it is it needs to be alot less and it needs to be a better game if they are going to charge this much for it there is not that much content there i like this game but at full price i dont think anyone should buy it,0
"it's pretty much the same ducktales of the nes with a added tutorial, actual dialogue for story and help to understand what to do. the difficulty is easier than what is was but it will give you that nostalgic feeling of the old game.",1
it continues to crash. very upset so far.,0
"if you want to just 'do stuff' in a game, run around, cause mayhem, drive for hours, fly planes, jump off of cliffs. this really is the game for it there are hours of fun to be had in just cause .",1

"i read a lot of comments before deciding to give villagers and heroes a try. and i can say, i'm glad i did. though i've only played about an hour or so i found i really like it. being an avid mmorpg gamer i was impressed at the games straight forward playing. it took me a bit to get used to things but the more i played the more i settled. i am glad to have found a game that i didn't feel pressured to have hurry to do this or that. in fact, i really enjoyed just being able to meander around the beginning town at my own pace exploring and getting familiar with things. i can say people who are looking for a laid back, play at your own pace and have an awesome time and happy time playing this game is for you. if you are looking for a heavy pvp or pressured pve this game is not for you.",1
this game does not work on linx mint . rosa! it seems the devs have no intention of fixing a downward selection menu bug. well update review upon fix,0
"i love everything about this game d,the story,graphics,the being able to run up onto walls and shoot enemies beyond awesome,it's godlike",1
-ps graphics -annoying bugs and may cause unplayable -updater..zzz.. the game has nothing unique to interest players to play it more..,0
telltale games made a good work. awesome story in a borderlands realm.,1
"overall, i liked the vibe of this game. however, the controls and the storyline made me give it a thumbs down. pros - pretty to look at - i love the back and forth action between the girl and the fox. it makes you think a little about who to use for what purpose. - the interviews about the inupiaq people were interesting, although the interviewees did not come off as very humble. cons - the controls are pretty annoying, most of the time. clunky. - it's pretty obvious what you need to do at any given time, until it's not..and you're stuck in one spot dying over and over again. - the storyline behind the game was pretty simplistic. simple conflict resolution, very minimal character development.",0
"low playerbase you wait a long time to queue and imo very unbalanced mechanics. there's a great deal of luck that goes into each stage because you are forced to play four cards in a row blind, which means it's hard to react to an opponent's strategy. it's a little like throwing darts at one another in a dark room - it comes down to luck over strategy or skill. i do really like the sense of progression with the leveling system and achievements, and i wish other tcg would incorporate this. but i think faeria, duelyst amp might and magic have far better underlying mechanics. but maybe this will appeal to some people.",0
"i really don't like the fact i need to dismantle stuff in order to move them. 'hey workers, dismantle this bed completely, take it to storage so you can bring it back, reassemble but this time facing north instead of east'. at scale it's disruptive and annoying because i need to remember everything i asked to dismantle so it can be reassembled in the place i had previously though of.",0
"better than i remember, but not worth playing.",0
"this game is great but is better than don't buy this version because euro truck simulator has better driving, graphics and much more",0
i f ken love it its the greatest game ever must buy,1
"sequel to the original gay son simulator. why be bothered with troublesome gameplay, excitement, or action? instead, brush up on medieval inheritance laws and politics. meet new and interesting people, and then kill them. name your daughters after the pretty girls that shunned you in high school and show them who's boss. some time in your dungeon will cure them off their snide sneers, and then you can show them your impressive, prosperous empire. it's good to be king!",1
the devs were pretty adament that this wasn't gonna be call of duty rainbow .. but guess what? it is and it sucks .,0
"ff - squaresoft's final fantasy series at its peak. if you need to look at a review for this game, you don't know what you've missed. if you like j-rpgs and like gameplay, characters and story over graphics, get this game now. it is bloody amazing.",1
"i really enjoy this game, but you have to deticate yourself to it. not in a significant way first the turtorial is really helpful and the community is as well. you will fail many times in this game everyone has, but when you understand the basics it can be really fun. here are somethings to remember when playing this game . be patient, the game takes a while to master and to learn .don't over play it in sitting otherwise it will be difficult to start playing again .be organized there are some pros and cons with this game that can be frustrating but enjoyable. pros good modding community detailed buildings and environment inteligent game that micromanages all the pesky things fun to play that gives you a sense of accomplishment and many more cons developer stopped working on this game the human ai isn't always inteligent takes a while to learn this is just my opinion of the game and if you are interested in getting it then watch gameplay from experts that explain the process of creating an excellent settlement",1
"i got this when it was on offer. it was only p and it was still not worth the money. its very short and not that fun at all. even if it was on offer for p i would still feel like its not worth the money. i only played the game for hour to get the trading cards so atleast i could sell the trading cards for some money back, just do not buy this game its a waste of money and time..",0
i loved it but no player base,0
"i tried many times throughout its development process and i must conclude this isn t for everyone, as i myself cannot get past the dialog. the writing style and characters are flat it reads like a young adult novella. it s a light and airy read when it s not too busy being jumbled, however, some of the personas are more caricatures then characters. persons requiring a higher standard in their reading my want to venture elsewhere.",0
"saw a disc of mount and blade at walmart at that weird pc games section. thought that it looked pretty legit so i bought it. i put the disc in and it said i had to download steam in order to play so i downloaded it and at that point i was introduced to the best thing ever steam. i installed mount and blade warband and pressed the play button.once i was in game i heard that sweet classical music and i started a new game. i chose swadia cause ya know whatevs. and at that point i tryed to play this game as much as i could,then i introduced my friends to this game and they loved it just as much as i did and this game became our lives",1
grindy game with slow animations? no thanks.,0
"this game is really good, but it has its downsides. i think that the idea about dlc went to their heads. but still, great game, fun to play with friends and lots to do!",1
there's no rl. only afk.,1
very entertaining and worth it.,1
can't even get past the frozen first screen.,0
"first game kills rest of team had kills combined building doesnt really matter that much, all you need is mines because everyone is completely unaware looks like it has 'skins' or playermodels you can buy, i feel like this game should be f p kinda boring tbh, some people call it a mash of minecraft and tf which is fair enough, but for me its like mixing ice cream and spicy chicken, not a good mix - -",0
"i do not know why this game is rated so horribly by all these people. i actually found this game very amusing and at some parts a bit challenging. while it does have its flaws in some places like not enough levels and infinite ammo and the enemies can run in mid air over giant gaps, it is still a fun shooting game.",1
"what a great game, the ai is more challenging, the maps are diverse, the story line is better, the units are balanced, it's a different feel from supcom .",1
it's far better than every cod and the newest battlefield games. you're looking for a cheap and good fps that you'll spent a lot of time with? take this game! you won't regret it. the price tag is nice,1
the elder scrolls v skyrim rest in pieces edition,0
"this game. to describe this game one must find the proper words to describe this game. so get out your dictionaries kiddos, it's word searching time! bad? no terrible? no atronomically awful? no broken heap of code? close, but no.. oh i know! it's actually pretty obvious what phrase works for two worlds ii sin against gaming there we go!",0
"medieval warfare to me, it falls short of its downloadable content counterpart, but none the less it is a superb medieval warfare heh simulator. the combat and movement is clean and precise and it's got quality gameplay all around. and hell, i'd be lying if i said the taunts and battle cries dont crack me up some. if you're into swords and shields battling, this is the game for you. deadliest warrior what's better than slicing a pirate to shreds with a katana while your buddy is about to cave your skull in with a mace? stop talking, there isn't anything. this entirely worthy of stand-alone dlc provides hours upon hours of fun and competetive combat along with a variety of different warrior customizations and weapons. the maps are diverse and the scenery is beautiful, though i don't know how much time you'll have to spend looking at the trees as a viking is chopping your limbs off. overall, out of would buy again.",1
"just the worst. unless you want another low graphics game, centered around dice rolling that rigged to you off. then don't bother. i don't even mind the low graphics, but it's very clear after at least tries to play the game, and attempts to get an endurance that doesn't roll below a every time. that it's not worth it. so glad i didn't spend a full dollar on this garbage. either fix your dice so monsters don't always roll and up, and i barely ever roll a and up ever. or don't bother making these games. it's obviously rigged, and i'm sick of seeing games like this come out of this company.",0
"played the out of diablo . downloaded this because reviews said i would stop playing d for this game. logged in, attacked some crabs on the beach. most of the hits landed - seconds after i swung. logged out and launched diablo .",0
"a text adventure for real puzzle-lovers. this is a game that's all about mastering something huge and complex. sophisticated automation of multi-step tasks helps you manage the complexity, but that just allows it to become even more complex. the alchemy here is a little reminiscent of the ritual magic in king's quest iii, but gives a stronger sense of being a system, with recipes that support substitutions. i originally played the ios version, but the steam version has the same content, with a somewhat improved ui. finally i can keep the alchemy journal open in a separate window while typing in commands!",1
"the problem is 'free mode' which is advertised in a way to give the idea of a free to play model, i think it's deliberately made to be misleading to fool f p players. i can't support such behauvior and neither should any gamer. the game itself was entertaining, at least for the short term since i quit the game as soon as i decided the managers wasn't explicit about free mode. the playerbase on steam never experiences a sustainable increase, mostly because of the free mode in my opinion since people don't get to play the characters they like after a rotation or they don't even get to their potentially favourite characters from the start and leave the game frustrated. in my opinion, a game should be either free or not. when it forces people to buy the game, it's not a pleasant experience for most. verdict",0
"boring, repetitive and easy. just racing against the clock. there is more than one opponent, but it does not make any sense, since colin mcrae is always the fastest opponent and it only matters whether you are in the st place or not. would be passable if it wasn't a time trial but rather a race with other components.",0
this game is a mild horror game with exploration at its core. it's a fun survival game that's not to hard to balance. food and water come often so it's not to easy to starve or get dehydrated. the story is pretty good as well! only issue i've had is once i got through the second temple i cannot progress any further. everytime i hit the loading screen the game freezes and loops the loading animation and song. not sure if this is a problem with the game itself or with my computer. i'll look into it more and update this review when i find the solution,1
"absolute , just absolute , poorly made, outdated crap. running a bloody gtx ti, this hunk of crap can still fall to fps doing absolutley nothing, it overworks the gpu like it actually needs to try and do something, despite the games still running like crap. it also crashes regularly and almost never runs perfectly, and if it does decide to lock up, oh your in for trouble, because if you try to end it through the task manager admin access is denied perfect example of a game where nothing is fixed and everything is broken, considerably worse than sonic even.",0
"insanity, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results-albert einstein. so what is it called when you do the same thing over and over again and get different results when you should be getting the same. what ever its called nobody should retry a map over times and not change one thing and win in the end. its a game with d parts on a d map, the ball will just role off the side for no reason. out of , payed .. sold cards for . each so that s . for each card in other words free.",0
this game is realy fun you must download if you are looking for a free fps,1
"this game is rubbish and a complete waste of my . i wish i have read the reviews and follow their advice, which is don't buy! the only game on my list that is worse than this is realms of arcania blade of destiny, which is a total con. you cannot save the game it only saves automatically whenever it wants , the combat system is bad, the interface is even worse, the graphics are rubbish, the voice acting is average and the story seems just ok - i wasn't going to waste more than the hrs i've already spent to find out if it was better than the other aspects of this game. the 'puzzles' are ludicrous, e.g. how do i open this door? oh there's a lever next to it! , the maps are small and linear. on top of that the game has crashed times in hrs for no apparent reason and the graphics movement are so bad that my eyes get tired after a few minutes of play time.. so save your money and buy something decent instead. needless to say that the . price tag is a bigger joke than the game itself.",0
loved playing this. eventually got bored but still great game and going back to play it today,1
"good game at first. this game is good at first but gets tedious quickly because of the similarity of missions or jobs or whatever. great with friends but boring as hell by yourself. basically a cop killing raging at your screen simulator once you get bored of attempting stealth and failing, also a rage game because online people tend to be slightly annoying when they kick you out of the game at the end just before you get the money or when the host rage quits offline when you so close to pulling off a pro job. overly an annoying game.",0
the best in the series.,1
"really challenging single player game. probably not one you can play again and again, but the content will last for a while since it's so hard and yet pretty interesting. a little role-play is possible, too. you can be the saviour of the world or even ruin it completely if you want.",1
"well, the boss is quite hard, but fk dis ending",0
ya kill zombies what more could you possibly want.,1

"i have been a long time fan of the assassin's creed games for a long time. i have played them all up to the most recent one due to hardware limitations. this one is by no means the best, in fact, it's the worst. i can't quite put my finger on why, but movement doesn't seem as natural as in the other games. combat is also much more difficult than in previous games, which can be looked at as a good thing or a bad thing. it defintely promotes stealth over open combat. you can also crouch in this game which is something that ac fans have been wanting for a while now. even though i like this game, and there is so much to do, i can't reccomend it because it didn't live up to the previous games.",0
could be a good game but only a white window appear when i start the game.. can i do anything to fix this problem?,0
"i got it, i played it, and i just didn't find it really fun.",0
out of it was a good work intresting characters cool history witty puns and sarcasim even though it is a murder case lol basic deduction and detective puzzles good ending i would recommend it to anyone who loves a detective style game that isn't cut bland and boring only con to short i finished it with almost in hours,1
"oh man, i mean this game.. if it really worked like that in . things were better that time and if you feel like you love someone and don't know what to do.. well i don't believe this game will helb, but you know.. try that",1
explosions and sound are very weak. gameplay seems very lacking and the units are soooo basic. every units basically fires the same projectile just different damage. the game really felt like a quick weak starcraft knockoff. strong ai however.,0
"you can play this game drunk, like tanked, and still be a master because it's turn based. cinematic where you snipe bad guys in the head are beautiful. easy to cheat at if you're a wuss and difficult as all frig if you're all buff and tough. this lovely title hits sale every once in awhile but it's definitely worth full price. the dlc is fantastic. i pre-purchased and didn't regret it. multiplayer is a god damn blast.",1
"bottom line if you're looking for another ftl, keep looking. i was a kickstarter backer and really wanted this game to be awesome, but it just isn't worth recommending. there are a lot of flaws in the gameplay, quests, story, visuals, music, interface, and pretty much every other category there are too many to list -- see here for an extremely thorough list. there was no point in me expounding when this guy already summed up everything i feel about this game. i would be happy to see this game receive patches that improve on these flaws and change my reviews to positive if they can address all the concerns out there. but there seem to be a rather large number of fundamental flaws, and i am not sure the devs can merely 'fix' them with patches here and there. i should add that i am not merely trying to compare this to ftl. i legitimately wanted to have fun with this for its own sake, and ftl merely serves as a convenient reference point, as according to steamspy, of convoy owners also own ftl.",0
"dead space remains both my favourite horror game and third-person shooter. the combination of engineer tools for weapons, unique kill system cut off the limbs , and atmosphere made the game both pleasantly frightening and refreshing in challenge. like any good horror game on the highest difficulty, you always feel like you're at a disadvantage, but the unfortunate catch is that once you've played through the game a couple times you begin to remember where the enemies spawn making even the higher difficulties less life threatening. i highly recommend this game to any fans of games like resident evil and anyone who wants a break from the monotonous headshot competition that other shooters often fall victim to.",1
"don't buy this! minutes in and i'm already stuck and definetely not going to start over if there is another place i can get stuck again. stop taking peoples money if you don't even bother fixing issues the game has! spoiler in my case, i was in a room where you escaped from the first vampire bat you meet on the second floor. i first got stuck in the fireplace view after i picked up a nail and didn't see the poker you were suppose to pickup too, so i quit the game then went back and now i can't pick up that poker in the fireplace or the nail since it's already in my inventory even though you can still see it in the fireplace.",0
"i'm playing this on a much lower spec gpu than most of the negative reviewers in fact it doesn't even meet the minimum requirements so settings are quite low but still at p and i'm finding it quite playable.. at first the initialize screen confused me hold e to get past in case you are wondering but once i was in i was blown away, it's such an odd place this world of mine.. minus temps in the day and colder at night, i am quite engrossed already in resource gathering and flora fauna discovery and i've only been at it an hour. i could see me easily losing a day on this and it to only feel like a few hours. not sure how i'll feel after hours of gameplay but inital impressions are good and if there are discoveries to be made on other worlds i'm all for a bit of planet-hopping fun!",1
"awesome game,maybe old-fashion but it is surely addictive!! once you start,you can not stop playing! i recommend you give it a try,it isnt gonna hurt. it takes minutes to download and its free! a big bonus is the fun,and yet level up feeling. as you collect crates for say,collect crates in life you unlock a new level to play on! now trust me,it may sound easy but it sure as hell isn't!",1
"old school.. somewhat revitalised far from the classic it's hailed as, though it still looks good and holds up decently after all these years, sparingly providing moments of mild fun. the story is unengaging and it's pretty much a mindless corridor shooter through samey environments, littered with incredible annoyances such as the game's dated insistence on cheap-shotting you by spawning enemies behind you and the massive oversight that is the lack of flashlight weapon attachments.",0

"hi there, this is freemium type of a game. i think it becomes higly addictive after few days, when you have many angels amp it somehow 'manipulate' you into spending more amp more time if not real money on it. it does not have real point, but it is funny, at least the way it somehow pulls you to play it, even if it does not a point. i mean, you only see numbers virtual money in it, but i bet many playaz buy 'virtual gold' for real money, because you can buy many 'extraz' in the game for it. the developers of this game came with really genius idea, which is this game, 'cuz its like a goldmine for 'em, i would do the same if i was in their shoes amp had such amazing idea but probably i don't have the 'how to make a game' knowledge , at least thats my opinion on this game. thanks for your time reading this, imind .",1

this turned me into evarno the sucidal human,1
great reboot of the old point-n-click game. voice acting is great. story and puzzles in part one are really good. part is not as good and forces you to make some unwanted choices. graphics are great and overall it is a superb game so far. i hope the remaining chapters will do it justice.,1

"fascinating modern spin on a cybperunk story that asks the question, what if we had the technology to alter peoples memories? many interesting ideas and quesitons are floated, set in an odd pastiche of future paris and zombie slums. sadly, the actual gameplay is extremely linear and mainly consists of linear tomb raider style climbign sequences but not as well executed and beat em up fights that get old quick. that said, the game features sequences of gameplay where you get to 'remix' someones memories..to change their memories of their own pasts, and thus their identies in the present. they are all very cool, and you probably have not played something like that before. i would have prefered this as an adventure game, without the combat or endless wall climbing. still though, worth a playthrough if you have a couple of long evenings to spend.",1
"this was a fun game to play when i was in university. i've since moved on to battlefield and , and i can say, without any reservation, that this was a fun game. there's a big learning curve for newcomers, but the reward is hours and hours of entertainment and interactions with your friends and opponents.",1
if you are looking for a top down shooter to play with some friends. don't buy this. the camera feels waaay to limited in this. buy running with rifles instead also no filthy dlc which i highly recommend to play with mates and have a top down shooter itch.,0
for people who want to buy this game keep in mind that this vn is not one in which you can make decision and take different routs which lead to different endings. you will basically sit about hours in front of you screen and read text after text but if that does not bother you much than this game offers you a nice story and a great soundtrack which underlines the experience and story told in the game.,1
the game is extremly glitchy if you have a newer machine spent hours in forums and messing with setting still could noit play it. i was disappointed as i really wanted to play oh well.,0
"i'll assume you've played some type of magic before in the past and save us both the detailed review of how to play. this version is free-to-play, which in my opinion, makes it better than the previous duels games. you need to play 'skill quests' which are mostly short tutorials for enough gold to open some packs. it's a bit of a waste of time for veterans of the game but i can be useful as a refresher. i don't think they will have any upkeep cards in this version. and yes, planeswalkers are in. most of the story mode missions are terrible. they are either way too easy or pit your unfocused premade vs a lethal boss with life jace boss . finally, there have been a huge amount of problems since launch with servers being down, people getting thousands of free gold coins, and i personally have had boosters worth of cards totally removed from my collection upon relaunching the game. right now i can't say i recommend this game, but once stability issues are resolved it will slide just barely into recommend. go play hearthstone right now instead for a reliable ccg.",0
"i finished the game. at the beginning i was dissapointed due to the lack of vito scaletta. as the game progressed, i became increasingly interested in the story, the setting, and how the game kept its mode. there were many repetitive phases in the game yet the story and the soundtrack full of good classics were enchanting and wonderful. on hard mode, the game is truly challenging. i have no regrets of playing this game, i really liked it.",1

the best game i've played in a long while,1

"tough game but a lot of fun to play co-op. the game consists of shooting amp running from zombies, looting vacant buildings, and visiting shops. shop prices vary, so you never know if the next one will have a good deal. ammo is always scarce so i was forced to buy up as much as possible early on. occasionally a vacant building will have an alarm which summons a horde of zombies, it's a quick way to end your game accidentally unless you're prepared. i would pay full price for this, but it's always best to wait for a sale.",1
"so, i loved this game when it came out. all of the fun heists and different playstyles you can use make a diverse game. it was fun to play with people together to get money and exp. so why am i not recommending this game? too much dlcs!! with all of the dlc avalible the cost for the game and the dlcs is over . and with the grinder perk deck, it made the diversity of the builds all the same. and the black market update added microtransactions!!",0

lara may be in better form in this game than she ever has before. the game looks and plays phenominally. the tressfx hair fx seems like a small thing but when you see it in action you'll be forever spoiled on the ever so common helmet head of most video games. really really excellent game. they have a multiplayer tacked on but does anyone play a tomb raider game for multiplayer?? this isn't a spoiler i don't think but this is the story before she became 'the' tomb raider not a reboot of the first game. still worth a play and i hope that she gets a chance to have another round as a sequel.,1
"much like all games from ubisoft, it crashes all the time. stick with just steam, ubisoft.",0
i really like this game. it has most everything i like in a turn based strategy game. for the price it is well worth it. the graphics engine in the game kind of sucks in that it is slow at times but do you really play strategy games for fluid graphics? most of the bad reviews of this game site it is buggy. i was at launch and while in beta but i have played hours and never encountered one bug or crash. for lt its worth it. i haven't even unlocked the nd level or rd level units.. but i love the diversity of play with ranged mele fast slow.. magic physical units. the enemies are interesting. the build paths for your stronghold are a bit confusing but using advanced mode for that helps. all in all i played this game almost hours straight with work breaks and time to sleep and i really like it.,1
to be honest i've only played one skirmish map so far and though the graphics look good and the mechanics suited well enough so far as getting things done but the problem is that the ai builds a huge force compared to what you will have time to build no matter how diligently you keep tabs on your production. maybe there's some obscure plan to increase unit production but i got totalled before i could field an army of more than . since rumor is that this game is considered a 'done deal' i have little hope this gets sorted out to make the rts skirmish maps playable. maybe the campaign is good. i don't know. might or mighht not bother playing it.,0
hard to play with only got a i and gb of ram..,1
"interesting idea, but gameplay elements are very tedious. would have loved it as a flash game, because that's what it feels like. i like deep stories and tactical combat, but this game just had me bored. need to make me care about the characters and story before things bog down - in this game, they're bogged down from the start. i feel like there's probably some good content buried in here, but the game just put me to sleep every time i tried to play for more than minutes at a time.",0

"i just finished this game and i had to take a minute to write about it. thomas was alone is probably one of the best games on my library as of right now. might be my favourite, topping off even bastion, the former champion. mainly because they did it. if heaven exists, douglas adams has already played this game, in a different kind of cloud, and cried many tears of joy for such a brilliant work. this game offers fun puzzles and a fantastic storyline, with a very immersing atmosphere created by some great background music by david housden and amazing - yet simple - looks. honestly, i consider this a out of and i just want more now.",1
"it was great mistake that i thought this was going to be another fantastic fps game. it was lack of information. i should've doubted more before buying. i thought every fps games are thrilling back then. never thought there were fps games like these. inefficient, unnecessarily realistic, military simulation game which is boring, tiring, and long. you have npcs helping you so single player mode feels like co-op a little. aiming is easy. - there is no clue in mapping. - once you miss some part of dialogue some clues are gone forver. you have to look it up on the internet. - in the map the arrow that represents you isn't looking where you're actually looking so you have to press m unnecessarily lot. - in some missions you don't know which one is side quests or main quests. - you die in one or three shots.",0

"tl dr - this s t is broken, not worth.. this game has some cool graphics and the gameplay is somewhat enjoyable no much than a casual top down shooter . but now to the ugly things , this game is so full of glitches that it shouldn't ever been put on sale in steam. problems if you walk of screen the game crashes down. values are inconsistent money, and variables like bullet speed seem broken and 'random' the change between levels is so weird that you don't know if its the same stage or not. and the problems keep going but i don't have all day.. final grade out of .",0

"over of my runs have prematurely ended because of a glitch. black loading screens between levels, stuck camera on boss fights, bosses that fail to enter a 'damage phase', bosses that fail to start, bosses that fail to open the door on completion, 'forever falling' glitches, doors and platforms that fail to open up the path forward, the list goes on. it's fun when it works but each run-ending glitch leaves a much more negative impact on my experience than the runs that go off without a hitch, i cannot recommend this game.",0

"this was my first telltale game, but i knew what to expect in terms of gameplay. it played like it was their first game, too, seeing how they've somehow not fixed any of the jankyness inherent to their products. what was irritating was how often it felt my decisions didn't really matter. sometimes it seems even the game admits this. one of the first things you do it decide how quickly to leave this older guy behind, prompting one the signiture 'x will remember this'. then ten seconds later he dies. even the game can't be bothered to keep things straight. get in a fight with some people that killed a pig farmer. kill one, then have the option to spare one of their lives. then, much later be told that i killed both of them. telltale did not remember that. i enjoyed watching let's plays of this game more than i did 'playing' it myself.",0
". out of ! very fun and rewarding game. the main story takes about hours to complete. has many elements similar to assassin's creed, but a different feel. most of the puzzles are able to get figured out without help, a few are harder. overall fun, decent story, replayable and worth your time.",1

"wow, a great way to have fun with a few friends and family. it think it works for kids at least yrs or mature enough to understand subtle humour sometimes, just so that they would enjoy it more . you don't have to be an artist, but what does help is a funny or creative way of looking at things. but really anyone can play. it works best with more people, i would recommend at least four people. with some friends over we could easily spend a couple of hours on this alone. note, keep in mind it requires a smart mobile device like a phone or tablet for each player.",1

good game. item drops makes it addicting to play. gotta collect em all!,1
pros - money goes to charity. - scripts are unsually funny especially if you're english cons - minutes of game play if you're not tired - all the levels are pretty much repeated. - very hard to navigate.,0
sluggish update download speeds. unplayable.,0
"awesome game! the way you first plan your moves and then execute them really fast, is brilliant! hours of absolute flow awaits you if you're go for all the achievements. if you are satisfied with just starring every level, it's closer to min. the way the game is divided into a 'planning stage' and a lt second execution stage is just brilliant. strongly reminds me of super meat boy, but shorter and less ragequit-inducing.",1

"i have no idea how i've put hours into this game. it's not the prettiest, it's not the smoothest, it doesn't have the best combat, it's a lot of repetition. but it's frickin' addicting, as in 'i just have to do this one more thing before shutting down, smash cut to am' kind of addicting. i have to fight myself as i write this not to fire it up and start playing again.",1

"this game will punish you, and it will punish you until you cry like a little boy girl. however, nothing is more satisfying than when you beat some of the thoughest parts of the game and learn to become a unstoppable maniac that even the hardiest bosses will fear. it has got a definite japanese vibe to it with the exploration of something like zelda and the brutality of something like metroid. a great game for those seeking extreme challenge, but before you beat it you might break a few controllers in the process. unforgiving and rewarding at the same time, only reccommended for the true masochists. p.s. only play with a contoller, the game is unplayable with keyboard and mouse.",1
"so i cant join hardly any servers. i can join some wasteland and altis life but when i try joining battleroyale it will not let me join. i have the arma kart dlc. most servers also have a yellow question mark on them, not sure what it means. i bought arma for the multiplayer. really upset it costed and i cant even enjoy the best part about the game. the campaign only lasted a couple hours. the ai will sometimes insant headshot you from across the entire island randomly, ruining the experience of the game. commanding your squad is so frustrating at times too. alot of things in this game are just not worth the money. very dissapointed. if you know how to fix the server issue please reply!",0
"the lag makes it almost unplayable and the servers are mostly empty everything is out of players except for two or three servers that have players max so even if it wasn't laggy it would be hard to find a good game. the vietnam dlc is straight up unplayable due to the way emptier servers i only found one server with out of players and the way more ridiculous lag. i've heard good things about this game, but it just didn't work for me so maybe it's just my computer not being able to handle old games. regardless, this is one of the most disappointing purchases i've made.",0
"this game is amazing! it is simple enough to learn quickly, but is complex enough to keep you interested. plus, it has a bit of star wars nostalgia, especially if you are into the expanded universe. it is also pleasing to bombard the gungans from orbit. those guys deserve to die after what they did to episodes i-iii. this game does suffer from bad graphics and some glitches, but this game is over ten years old, so that makes sense. and if you get bored of the original game expansion, there are some really good mods out there to make things more interesting. love this game!",1

"left dead is a very fun game, especially if you are playing with your friends. it is utterly hilarious whenever a special zombie immobilizes one of your friends. although this is fun and hilarious, after you play through all of the campaigns for it, it can get a little boring and i can only play through about or campaigns until i get bored and move onto another game to play with my friends. this game has decent graphics, so it can run on labtops with integrated graphics, but it will probably be a little choppy if you don't have a gpu in your computer. i definitely do recommend this game because it is not a game that you will play-out in a couple of weeks and is a game that you will keep coming back to with your friends.",1
"really gorgeous game, with a great story, great soundtrack and progression of skills. however, the difficulty is too high. usually you are able to save almost anywhere, but during specific vital sequences, you are unable to save. those sequences requires flawless execution of complicated manouvres, with no room for error. trying to get through them was more frustrating that fun challenging.",1
"it's very clunky, they should really sort the engine out for the game and maybe you might want to try and figure it out. after first playing it and being clunky, i would say don't buy this game. it's a shame they have destroyed a brand to a point i never picked it up again. but you have parkitect and planet coaster. final note, don't buy it..",0

waited years for ffvi to come to steam. i grew up with this rpg. constantly renting it from blockbuster as a kid because my saved game would get wiped by someone else. this is a poor ios port. the resolution ends at . put this to wide screen and it looks hideous with the sides being black bars. se literally just took the ios port and changed a few lines of code so it would work with pc and charged the same price. shame too. this is a classic game. instead it uses the new sprites from the ios release and not the original sprites from the snes version. i had to refund it because it's not what i expected.,0

"i was excited to get this, but i honestly cannot recommend it. the controls are clunky and frustrating, and it feels like there is actual latency in the single player game that makes it worse. occasionally you will try to control a different guy, only to have the game not recognise that you clicked on someone else, sending the one you just positioned to the other end of the room, burning all your command points, and killing everyone.",0
"i actually like it, or at least so far.",1
-game crashed on loading screen twice. - not sure if any audio is missing on the cutscenes but it should have something as its boring sitting through ambient sound. - no real tutorial on what to do. - options could do with their own menu instead of being around the minimap. has a great potential with the art style but needs more work.,0

"monkey island mi is a unique blend of bizarro characters, whacky plots amp even stranger puzzles! the most entertaining aspect of monkey island though is the humor used throughout in the dialog, situations amp actions you perform. it's rare to have humor used so well in a game. with your want-to-be pirate , 'hero', ahem , guybrush threepwood there are plenty of hair-pulling challenges amp interesting locations to explore. there is even swashbuckling sword play, although in a much more creatively different way than you would ever expect! mind you, that will happen a lot in mi, where the most creative .. strange .. crazy step is often the next step, not the logical one you think. the fresh coat of paint in the special edition with its d-ish cartoon look enhances the setting well, although you can also switch to the classic graphics at any time too! voice acting is excellent taking full advantage of the great dialog. always enjoyable taking a pirate holiday back to mi! yarr! timeless point 'n' click adventure! one of the best! if you enjoyed reading this review, please follow true blue reviews for more recommendations!",1
"it is rare when i am stunned by a game. often games can be entertaining, visually stunning or encompase complex story arcs, but rarely do they acheive all three. remember me is a beautiful game. i lost count how many times i just sat back and looked at the environment, often getting attacked in the process. the combat is not complex once you get used to it and by the end you flow around your enermy, dancing between blows like a ballet of violance. the story is imaginative, thoughtful and well written, with strong voice acting and presence. in the end you drift past the combat, knowing that your enermy will meet their poetic demise, because all you desire is to understand the next glimpse of your fractured memory. this game is a cross between deus ex, mirrors edge and a film i used to love called renaissance staring daniel craig . if i were to critic this game, and i am loathed to do so, it is a little short and i completed it in about hours.",1
"the game is simply beautiful. it was gifted to me by a friend under a premise of not knowing anything about the game but to simply download it and play it. i thoroughly enjoyed the peacful experience that the game brings. it has great flow, great controlls, beautiful soundtrack and is just a joy to play. would recommend to everyone.",1

"the game is definitely a mind bender. while the controls are simple, the world a side scrolling d world, this is far from a boring game. the story, the art style, the bakgrounds, everything makes you think and wonder what is going on. even some of the later game mechanics make you ponder what the world is. for those of you that have not played it, i suggest giving it a try. it requires critical thinking and problem solving, but not in the ways one might think. every situation has a solution, whether easy to see or not. great game by my standards, and interestingly enough, this game actually frustrated me at some points when i couldn't solve the problems outright, which is what i tend to do in most games. that being said, i highly recommend this game.",1

nice work you idiots the entire game is ruined by those incredibly annoying death messages im getting my refund everything was so cool but noooooo the stupid game wants to let you know every seconds that one of your own has died like really i dont give a crap fix it now! im not recomending this game until those death messages are removed,0

"buy it on sale if it's under .. as so many others have said, i like x type games and i loved alpha centauri. i still play ac every so often. this game has some interesting ideas, some fun units and some nice artwork. what kills it for me and why i had to down vote the game is the lack of replayability. lt spoilers ahead gt after the first couple of games, you know basically how the eras are going to go. you know that night will fall, you know that an alien menace will come from gates that must be closed and what kills it is that you know when and how these things will happen. these aren't cool random events, they happen every time. so all you're really doing is playing the exact same set of 'random' events again and again. perhaps wwii simulation players who enjoy re-playing battles over and over using slightly different tactics or from different angles would be more appreciative of this title. for x players or at least for me it's too static.",0
this game is more broken than my heart after my father left me.,0
"this game is, in my opinion the best game ever made. new vegas has a masterfully crafted atmosphere that is second to none. the story perfectly complements the setting while also giving the player an incredible amount of choice and power when it comes to the events that unfold in the game. i have never seen so much freedom in a game. along with great gameplay and fine tuned rpg mechanics, fallout new vegas has an amazing soundtrack. the in game radios are perfect with huge playlist of great songs, the music made for the game by inon zur is also stellar. this is a must buy for any fan of rpgs or gaming in general . out of",1
i barely have any play time but that's literally how much of the game i wanted to play until i lost interest. it feels kinda clunky to play and it just isnt scary.,0

worst port ever! doesn't work!,0
i have seen better games. there is only one way to kill somebody sometimes really stupid what is just boring. when u finish the game u have no reason to play it again what makes game really short. i think this game had very high potential but game developers ruined it.,0

"news flash! this game is dino beatdown..yes, the overpriced, broken, glitchy piece of software that was released almost years ago. for those that bought the game back then, you've probably noticed it has a new name..and that it actually works now! this game finally offers what they promised at the point of sale. is it perfect? nope. is it worth trying out again? absolutely. and..for . cents, you can invite some friends to try it out with you, too.",1
"gfwl pretty much tries to take over your computer and your soul. the monstrosity that was games for windows live's only purpose seems to have been to obfuscate running a game so much that people stop buying games and turn to piracy. i wish gruesome and physical harm upon the people who took the decisions and designed this system. and rockstar should be physically and repeatedly slapped over the face for implementing this system. not only have i lost any disposition to play, as well as the couple of spare hours i had available for doing so, but i just never want to play any gta game ever again. getting back the money i paid for this steaming mess would still feel like i got robbed. later edit having managed to wade through the mess that is gfwl and ending up creating an offline account, i've had no more problems with the whole thing. the game is great, but that should be common knowledge by now.",0

"from reading the other reviews, i can deduce this is a terrible game. therefore instead of playing it, i decided to idle it for five minutes in order to contribute to it's failure. these developers ought to be ashamed of themsleves, and i wish them all the worst in their future endevours.",0

"violent, simple and clean, filled with humor and high octane action. it plays like a higher-octane version of stranglehold with the tight control and sensibilities of an old-school nes game. every run and level dares you do it just a little better each time. is the game short? it was seem so, even with its unlockables, but i recommend it for the price point. in conclusion, if you love old-school aesthetics and control, brutal gun-battles and action movies, i'd say this is the game to play.",1
"do not buy this game on steam. the pc port is absolutely terrible. the frame rate is horrible even on high end pc's, audio and video glitches, weird movement bugs, old game like this should have been working fine on my pc but all i see is fps at the most.",0

"i tried turning down the volume of the game with the audiomixer of windows, since i didn't saw the volume bar in the main menu right away- turns out, that if the loses the focus, it first of all turns black, but second of all it lags the audiomixer to death. also that font is incredibly ugly",0

best game ever. if you liked ac then this game will be x the fun.,1
"fantastic game! oriented more towards people with no skill, like myself. it's a horror related, almost super mario like game. except, i wouldn't eat the mushrooms if i were you.",1
this game had huge potential and was completely wasted. on release it was no better that a late alpha release with a ton of bugs that haven't been patched in the least. exploits and hacks are rampant in every lobby you get into with iw not doing anything about it. on the average there are barely k players and those numbers are dwindling fast. save your money and buy something else.,0

"i can't say i'm overly far but from what i've seen is, this game is going to put up so many bariers that can only be mitigated by massive amounts of microtransactions. which is a shame because so much of the game seems really interesting. early game combat is fun, the taming system is engaging, and the over aesthetics are beautiful. but those microtransactions waste no time getting in your face. not even lvl and i'm, running out of bag slots, running out of bank slots, ran out of pet slots.. if this had gone the guildwars route, i think it would have been a really great game. tl dr fun game with bad economy system and for me, it's a no because of that.",0
"despite its cool aesthetic, darwinia's gameplay was slow, laborious, and frustrating. there is definitely strategy involved, but it was never satisfying to execute. don't get me wrong -- darwinia is not a bad game by any means, and i would definitely recommend it to certain gamers. but it was a game that just wasn't enjoyable for me.",0

i previously owned this game on my xbox and now that i have switched to pc i got it on pc too ! gotham city impostors is one of my favorites with several guns to choose from guns that shoot parrots to ball bearings lol. the game has character types to choose from but i prefer the mighty one.the game provides you with several side items to use like roller skates to divewings not exactly ! you will find yourself often annoyed by snipers and bombers but once you know thier positions it's preety easy to eliminate them. this game has one of the most loyal community i have ever seen but has very few maps i guess . you will love the homour of the game. plus it's free . i can't ask for more though it would have been better off with more maps and more dev support . now to server problem. if youn find yourself not finding servers then just change your download region to new york and you are done,1
"general overview i picked up up during a steam winter sale when i had plenty of time on my hands. i sunk hours into the regular unmodded version then picked up a few mods and never looked back. i can easily see each mod taking hours and that's just single player for one playthrough. this game is fantastic in its strategy when modded. great if you enjoy being able to both fight in large battles and manage a kingdom. pros tons of mods for everything you can think of unlimited replayability multiplayer fairly active depending on mod low requirements medieval setting is generally adhered to cons native unmodded has a few bugs and balance issues can become repetitive quickly lacks some strategy elements if unmodded tl dr great game with tons of content to explore already use mods to enhance it even further and you'll have tons more hours to play. if you enjoy medieval fighting and strategy, this is for you.",1
"frustrating obstacles past hazard where the game goes too fast and you cannot pass them no matter how hard you try ex wall slide log . the problem isn't the fact that it goes fast i like fast games , the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility. you have to jump to pass the wall, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed unless you are lucky with the layout. and the game hasn't much to offer, it's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind it takes hours in order to be able to buy an uninspired upgrade there are so many better endless runners, free and paying, i can't find the appeal of this one.",0
"surprisingly problematic for an old game that was 'remastered' it would be more accurate to call this a retexture. old bugs persists. practically no graphical options in comparison to the original. some areas and scenes look objectively worse low quality shadows, character models not casting accurate shadows ie floating hands and heads etc, missing shadows, removed reflections etc etc there's also problems with performance, which shouldn't be the case. all in all, if you get it for free and it runs well, go for it. do not buy it.",0

the main campain keeps getting crashing. restared the game from the beggining for a fresh save crashed again. sigh shame but oh well so play the sandbox. and this is where its very samey after one or two hours you likely have built every variation of unit and house you can. wanted to like this game after watching it for ages but very tierd of this title very quickly. really wanted this to be the true path of what rome total war could have been but its even worse. the combat is a simple numbers game and doesnt seam to have a huge impact however you play it tacticly.,0
"i really like this game, i do. super fun it's repetitive, but i also play csgo and lol which are repititive as well. problem is, is that the ing co-op support sucks . you can't even switch servers to play with your friends. if you're in it for the co-op and the fact this game's co-op support is worse than star forge then thats a deal breaker.",0

"killer is too overpowered and the developers clearly don't see that. as of the most recent update .. , they literally buffed nearly all the killers perks, didn't touch the survivor perks and called it 'perk balancing'.",0
at beginning as multiplayer gameplay was poor but the game has been improved a specialty since is running on linux.,1
"the banner saga has great animation, a compelling story, and choices that really matter.",1
this game is good if your looking for some different but its not amazing. worth the i got it for.,1
"i seriously hate this game. i wont spoil but the ending. i cant. it does look fun but at first it takes what seems like hits to kill a zombie but only for a zombie to kill you, which results in you losing tonnnssssss of xp. parkor can be fun at times but its torturing going across the map falling from buildings, zombies grabbing onto you.. its just errggghhhh. the game gets better once you unlock the grapling hook. its fun but at night if youre running from sp ky it has to recharge after uses. this can be life or death, for me it usually resulted in death. finding weapons is seriously all about luck. in a chest you could find anything from a rusty spoon or a katana, usually ending with something in the middle. you could always buy them for the insane prices. i wish i had my money back, i should have waited for the new dead island. and touching on that i enjoyed the first dead island wwwaaaaaayyyyyy more then this. but enough of that. out of would play wallet robber again. dont buy it.",0
"take whatever this costs in your local currency, make that into loose change, throw it on the floor - voila! - portable version!! i suspect that already exists - of course - on a device which lacks a 'right mouse button' because this doesn't seem to know we have those click twice - twice - do you know how much mice cost, we'll wear it out!! the portable version wouldn't show you shortfalls either - something a computer can do - but hey, this doesn't.. this may not even be a game - no actual effort was made to add anything over 'add up numbers in your head' - you could actually play this without owning it and not really know.. seriously - the idea is to make a game which makes use of the pc in some clever ways - i think they forgot that bit?",0
i trade to buy fallout but it dosnt work on windows so but this and its boss,1
"i usually like to play little indie games, for their artistic value, but this one.. clicking times on a door to open it ? where is the fun ? just forget it and play real games.",0
"really fun, has a zombies type game! awesome and free",1
out of would not play again,0
"game most touching feature to me is delivering very well crafted substantional guided tour on matter. presented virtually at your finger tips. being huge francophone fan, i was trully inspired to visit once again sights and places. cheering with all my heart this wonderful narrative, connection between history, today life and emotion of the momentum. tl dr one of the best history classes cases ever.",1
this game is pretty nice. some might say it is the . i am one of those people.,1
"do not get thos game!! i happened to be fortunate enough to buy it at cents. you know, before steam stoped making sales for anything less than cents. but if you want the gaming community's biggest fest, get this. all-in-all, - out of",0
"excellent port. even on my old laptop it runs perfectly the game so far is really good, great dialogue and interesting gameplay i recommend this game. out of so far",1
"still to the day one of my fave games, and playing it gives me so much nostalgia",1
i wish this is will be free to play,0
"very short game, sadly. out of",1
it's you! the hero of kvatch!,1
this is a classic in the same line as dungeon keeper. hits that classic james bond austin powers feel and could really use a remake that wasn't aimed at mobile gaming. do yourself a favor and play a little gaming history.,1
its free. its fast paced. it'll keep you on the edge of your seat. what more could you want?,1
"ignore the poor reviews on this one - if you're a fan of rocksteady's vision of the batman universe, i recommend this game highly. exploring old gotham before the flood is a treat and the new voice actors perform admirably, considering the shoes they had to fill.",1
"august i preordered this game because i have put a lot of time into payday the heist and loved it. playing the beta for a week or so i thought that this is a big improvement and still needs some tweaking here and there. up to about febuary or march the game was fine until the developers started nerfing stealth and other aspects that made the game almost impossible. then adding death wish which was an absolute nightmare, unless a friendly hacker decides that he's had enough of overkill's horrid abomination of a decision to help the team out. this game was amazing before the dlc's, nerfing, and other updates started to flood the great co-op experience. r.i.p payday",0
"with all of the graphical and performance issues, i say wait until some patches are released. it's a pretty fun game, but not worth with it's current bug infestation.",0
"first of all.. not nearly as scary as outlast. damn you outlast for spoling me with fear!! so if you are looking for something like that.. then no. that being said, the game itself is quite lovely looking. game play is very straighforward..you can't really go anywhere wrong. it kind of plays itself. it's spooky, but not crippling scary. and as usual, no weapons in these horror games. i played with keyboard and mouse. finished in less than hrs without achievements.. but only because i like to open cabinets. graphics well done! bugs actually didn't find anything in my travels. motionsickness oddly i didn't feel sick playing. odd, considering how many hallways there are. the fov is pretty spot on. story is ok. unravels itself as you play. would i recommend this game? yes! however.. do not expect to have a game experience like amnesia or outlast where you have to hide in shadows and sneak around. there are some jump scares, tho. this game is creepy spooky, but for me it wasn't overly scary. bottom line play it for the experience, but not for scares.",1
. out of no m jokes just a serious review,1
"bounce, jump, run, die,then repeat out of",1
it is a perfect screen recorder i would highly recomend it but the price is a little to much. oops caps srry,1
no thanks. huge difference from sa and .. much of a difference. waste of money if you have played and .,0
this tf dlc really sucks,0
"best game, best performance, best tudo",1
"this game is broken, i lost all my save games after completion. wbid sucks big time.",0
"not much to say.. i could pay people to remove this from my steam library.. its literally the dumbest i ever seen, you first pee on people and then burn them with fire.. like really come on..",0
"there a a few better racing games than this. assetto corsa, project cars, rfactor. go for those instead. the dlc is off the charts on price. some series that you buy dont count towards any irating or safety rating, so is plagued with trolls there to wreck and spoil your day. iracing really cares nothing for this with their fake smokescreen report policy. all the want is your cash. be prepared to literally have thousands of dollars in cash if you want to participate in all iracing has to offer. they obvouisly think their feces does'nt stink, but this 'game', is not all that..",0
"the good the sense of freedom, the laugh outloud humor, the variety of weapons and powers, and the depth of content. the bad story is meh, repetition in some forms of gameplay, lack of enemy types. the bottom line like skyrim but with gta! in all seriousness, if you like open-world games that attempt to entertain you above all else, give sr a try. if you really liked saints row and , you may wish to stay away. a lot of fans from the earlier games didn't like this one at all.",1
"if you are a fighting game enthusiast, this is a must get. pros . online play works fine at least with people in my area with no lag. .great music .plays smoothly .decent amount of content . is't king of fighters!! cons . outdated graphics may turn off newcomers to the series or people who might be curious this game is one of the best fighting games to come to steam, and i hope more title like this come to the store in the future.",1
"wanted to try it out for my son, but couldn't even play it - black map no matter what level i tried. went through all the graphics options, even used the debug mode, windows compatibility mode, fullscreen windowed, etc. never got a chance to see what the game was like.",0
"toby the secret mine is a beutfiul little puzzle-platformer game. very much like limbo, the game shows off some fantastic looking visual effects, possibly some of the best i have seen in a very long time. there are lots of different puzzles to solve, and can be quite challenging. the game runs amazingly, and most importantly, its fun. here is a little video i put together just showing off some of the features in the game.",1
"handheld peasant, pc master race, dirty liberal, conservative, white man, beaner, no matter who you are, you can enjoy this game trumpforpresident k",1
im not recommending this game because all people do is use shotguns and it needs more guns and modes,0
i thought i would just give it a quick try to see what is like..it is not past midnight! amazing,1
"the game itself, is fun, graphics are interesting gameplay mechanics are simple and easy to understand at low skill levels, but complicated and take a lot of time to figure out at harder ones, the game was overaly enjoyable, but the complexivity of items and the gery of players make it.. meh. i don't know a lot about dota ,but this is the imppresion i got from all the time i have played. if a friend of mine hadn't told me the real name i would think dota would stand for den of tryhard hats. of course, i haven't played much, but this is the imppresion i got when i started overaly enjoyable, but unless you have enough friends for a full team avalble at all times, don't bother.",0
you topple a southeast asian dictatorship to take their oil. out of would be america again,1
if you got here you stumbled onto that part of steam. i suggest you leave.,0
very simple and addictive game.,1
way too hard. even on easy you have to reload all the time..,0
to be quite honest it was not as fun as i thought it would be. the cars were terrible. out of,0
the maximum amount of gameplay you can get is minutes before you have to fork over for the cash. there are also a disturbing amount of people trying to troll disturb the intended audience little kids .,0
"very short! - hours max. cool point and click adventure. interesting notepad mechanic. worth the money, when the game is on sale right now ct.",1
the game is very good but when i played it i didnt hear anything. maby it's my computer but still it's very borring without sounds.,1
soo much fun and stuff to do,1
"i put well over hours or so into this game when i was younger, and it still holds up pretty well. building your town into an empire and fending off attacking nations is stategic, challenging, and rewarding. i also enjoy creating my own maps, it really lets you get creative.",1
"literally unplayable. despite having decent system amp trying work arounds. cannot recommend that anyone purchase this game. does not even get to the main menu. frame skipping, audio dropping out, won't run full screen. very disappointing.",0
"for those who know the legacy of kain series, nothing needs to be said. it's a fantastic series and while it has it's faults, this is a joy to play, to watch and to experience. i can only hope that those giving this a go can find their way into enjoying the fantastic story this game presents you with.",1
"i hate to downvote this game, but it freezes on the end boss for a lot of people , including me. it sounds like it's related to nvidia's newer drivers but i'm not sure. the game itself is a solid if not particularly impressive affair. the graphics are obviously an improvement over the original, but compared to the recent remake of castle of illusion this remaster is kind of disappointing. if you are looking for a great disney platformer i'd recommend trying that one first. this is worth picking up for sometime, though, if you are a disney fan or like d platformers. however, i'd hold off until it's patched - otherwise you might not be able to finish it.",0
sucks!! althe way to the button config!,0
man this game used to be my favourite.. but then the updates started comin it turned to it is grindy af now all you do is go around killing sour worms,0
"this game is good, best open world survival i ever played so far..",1
"there's some potential here, but the jokes fell flat for me, the protagonist's comments became grating, and as previously noted, the first episode is far too short..",0
the 's that should have been.,1
"i wanted to like this game, but sadly it gets stale and repetitive after about or hours. the story and characters are uninteresting. the world seems cool at first, but you realize it's very shallow early on. each unit only has a handful of abilitys that you end up using the same way every fight, which made me start to dread fighting until i just said why am i still playing this. the levels are uninteresting however i did like the graphics. i also loved the world map, it reminded me of old school jrpgs, too bad all the things that made that genre great were missing.",0
can not cange resolution. feels like a mobile game ported to pc and probably is,0
will make you hate life. in a good way.,1
"i really would like to continue playing this to know the whole story from the first game, but the gameplay drags me down. boring combat system and long distances to walk from one place to another just for small tasks. and it get's a hundred times worse when you can't figure out where to find what you're looking for. , out of",0
"i thought this game would've been better than omsi , but it turns out, it's pretty much the same on spandau, below fps bouncy bus.. the one thing that gets on my nerves when i really try and do these routes, i dont even know why i bothered paying for this. where i could've gone on ts and bought the london - faversham pack for , but nope, the bendy bus amp single-decker buses lured me into buying this game, hoping that my new toshiba windows . laptop would've been better than my previous one, in grundorf its fps which is great, but the map is boring and small. it always seems to bounce up and down near the spandau station. i wish i could go back in time and made myself not buy this absolute waste of money 'trampoline' game.",0
"brothers - a tale of two sons it not a game. its a piece of art, an adventure that is able to stir with all your feelings. .unique and solid gameplay if you have a jpad .a wonderful story told in a unique and spectacular way",1
"i've played through every single heroes of might and magic game as they were released, and this is definitely my favorite one post-homm iii. the improved gameplay and interface over v, the more cohesive castles, and series-unique take on magic make it very engaging. the campaign is much better than iv or v as well. but like everyone else has mentioned, this game is absolutely crippled by always-online drm, having to log into install uplay, and weird overpowered unlocks tied to an achievement point system cash shop. you will get booted from your game arbitrarily. it will happen, and more than once. until this game is disconnected from all the ubisoft garbage, i can't recommend this game at all.",0
all play this game it's so beautiful,1
"i always liked the incredible machine and this is back to the roots with workshop and achievements and multiplayer. simple but perfect game! the objective, as it's always been, is to solve puzzles any way you can think by making the tools provided interact with each other. just like bad rats, wait what?!",1
i love gta iv's story and game in general but it has some optimization issues,1
"crapcom doesn't know how to make pc games that actually work on pc. just to get a controller to work in this game, you have to jump through hoops that are lit on fire. this game is better on a ps emulator than on any other system, and that shows crapcom's incompetence in general. update i've gotten my controller to work in this game by uninstalling it and resintalliing it and doing nothing else. i'll update this review to positive if i can beat this game similar to how i played it on ps and a ps emulator.",0
it has performance issues after the new updates. rockstar made a patch but it didn't work for me and many others. what happend rockstar? getting banned a third time for no reason. and whats wrong with mods? fix your game!,0
"what needs to be said really, its one of the good guilty gear games! its an older pc port and as such it does have one thing to keep in mind, that is i highly recommend using joy key rather than the inbuilt controller setup system as it doesnt allow you to force map movement to your d-pad on a normal xbox controller, playing a fighter on an analog stick is hard and not as fun as you will see in the video below i had issues pulling out most moves but with that in mind its totally worth it! video review below",1
out of would play again,1
"simply beautiful. as another reviewer states not a game, but an experience. a vignette. you visit a series of locations in a valley on the cusp of destruction and learn the history of the civilisation that flourished there over thousands of years. the artwork, score and text combine to build a magnificently melancholy atmosphere as you explore, leading to the game's satisfying culmination. recommended if it sounds like your cup of tea.",1
i sure do love games that dont have mouse cursors for menus and take mintues to exit out from,0
"this game taught us that loader have feeling and heart. he know the meaning of betrayal. and i've kill so many of it in the past, i feel guilty.. out of won't kill any loader next time",1
"this is my new favorite application and my best purchase on steam ever. not only does it enable full control of your pc with a controller, it bridges the gap between games with partial controller support and full controller support. take project cars for example. you'd obviously want a wheel or a controller to play a racing game, however in order to exit the game you need to drag the mouse into the top right corner. so what do you do? you hold the back button and hit start and all of a sudden you are navigating a mouse with your controller using the 'a' button as the left mouse click. absolutely essential buy for controller users, big picture users and people who use controllers to play on laptops when space is limited. for the price this is a must buy. out of",1
"returning to it's roots, all-be-it in a simplified manner, might and magic x - legacy is a reboot in the right direction despite the stumbles. a nice new art direction favouring the look of the previous titles , it's nonetheless dragged down by poor pc optimisation and frequent fps drops. nothing game breaking but battle-music looping bugs does tarnish an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable experience. the game feels less complex than previous iterations, and this isn't such a bad thing as you have a clear idea what skills to maximise as you level up. what does it do flawlessly? hooking the player in.. i'm not sure why but after they optimised the tile-walking from the open beta i find myself encouraged to search the next dungeon, forest, cave, or castle whatever it might be. i had my house-mate sit down next to me and watch for hours as we quested, he enjoyed watching the adventuring and even the turn-based battles as i adjusted my tactics to suit the circumstances. good game in my opinion, i think this is a step in the right direction and hope to see a sequel.",1
exceptional game! ahead of its time. don't be put off by the occasional difficult level. if you enjoyed this game then half-life is another must own.,1
"either you're a veteran with no life or you're here for the tf hats. if you are like me, from tf be warned. you'll spend more time in the lobbies than you can spend crawling on all fours from dallas to sydney.",0
"the bear game gives you almost nothing other than an physics engine. the rest is up to you to fork out in over priced dlc edited for version thanks a bunch dovetail. you lie to us about what your doing, you claim to fix things that have plagued your game for over years. now that i can cope with, that doesn't affect me often enough to care. what really, really gets me is when you force me to half upgrade to a bodged version of the game designed to persuade people into paying for a game that based on game play footage from a number of sources is totally identical to the previous game and then you completely break my game so that i can no longer load any work shop content i have subscribed to, maps that i have created and freeware that i have downloaded. thanks again for ruining a perfectly happy and pleasant experience. i wouldn't recommend this recent mess to anyone if it killed me.",0
"an initially entertaining game that quickly becomes repetitive and boring. very shallow game elements - story, character growth, combat mechanics - make each play through progressively less fun and interesting.",0
"feels like a free to play game. kinda choppy, weird animations, etc. they should've spent another year on it before releasing the beta as far as i'm concerned. it's cool that the graphics are a step above other f p fps games, but it still seems to lack depth. i'm just going to say no thanks. i'd rather spend my time playing other games.",0
this game is definitly going in as one of my top favorites of all time. i loved the way the story played out and worked up to the ending out of stars,1
"cant even launch this stupid game, good job ubisoft, is it amd's fault?",0
"got this game as a part of a bundle. if the mini racing genre does not already appeal to you, bang bang racing will not change your mind. might be fun for family multiplayer.",0
this is one of the greatest games ever created. one of the greates sagas ever created.three words just play it!!,1
this game fails to explain the story also you have to read a bunch of notes all the time and they don't explain much and the ending feels lackluster.,0
"hackers, hackers everywhere. still fun . out of",1
"hello m 's. i think you shouldnt buy this game here. it doesnt have mlg in it, either. its very boring. anyways, screw you guys, im going home.",0
everyone is a jerk and you're going to recieve death threats for the slightest screw up out of,1
"wow.. i must say that i am rather impressed! yes, it is short and not so terrifying, but it is quite fun to play. a free, good looking game, with a couple of easy to earn achievements? yeah, no one's complaining here. props to you, devs! considering the bigger piles of excrement sitting out there, this one is a shimmering gem. i enjoyed myself while playing.",1
"i have oplayed this game way to much and i would recommend it to everyone. but the amount of grinding and rng in this game is higher than the amount of people that believe the earth is still flat. not fun for me anyumore but try it out,pretty cool being a space ninja ripping enemies appart",1
"i expected this game to be awful and glitchy. however, i found neither of those to be true and ultimately enjoyed myself. out of hats.",0
"i don't want to bash this game but it has its ups and downs. but really, the biggest disappointment for me was the scare. there may be one or two parts which will make you jump and go 'oh !' but thats about it, and it gets really boring slowly and drops downhill. i honestly feel that this second installment of amnesia doesn't stand up to the first. the first gamse was not only scary but it also had some unique elements which are taken away in this game. i am glad that i got this during the steam sales otherwise i could have paid a heavy price for it. and yes, just like everyone else that loves amnesia, i was waiting to play this game badly. but now i wish i wasn't so tempted to play it in the first place.",0
"the missions are too long, the loot is universally unimpressive, the difficulty scale is utterly broken.",0
"being a big fan from the st dmc till now, i think the change has been dramatic. do i recommend it? of course. a typical hack and slash game comes with a huge amount of upgrades to your main weapon. with skills that are impecable to look at and the blood spewing from the enemies, it could clearly top all hack and slash games. though the story wasnt as interesting as i expect it to be, the strongest aspect of the game isn't the gameplay, it's all about the presentation, level design and art direction. dmc screams out replayability and i just can't wait to play it again once i finished.",1
"well hard to give it a bad review but can't really give it a good one either. but as it stands i'll have to give it a no, in it's current state. main issues most of the crafting locked behind random drops no common spots to find blueprints or cash shop very little crafting in general combat is still a little glitchy especially melee, which is what you wind up doing most of the time movement speed is slow sprinting is the same as walking in most games but for me the fact so much of the crafting requires money or random drops is just meh, can work around the rest but those are the kickers.",0
games pretty damn simple. you get to make an anime babe and click on other anime babes.,1
"i have loved the total war franchise for a very long time. however, i found this one to be mostly just frustrating as there is no way to adjust the difficulty level of the campaign portion, leaving you mostly pressing end turn instead of being able to enjoy the battles. definatley the worst total war i have played.",0
really fun game. getting all new stuff and making underwater bases. awesome out of,1
"i absolutely love this game. the characters are wonderfully built and cosistent and it's a great story. once i got the feel for the main character from the first chapter there wasn't anything i got particularly stuck on. the only hint i would give new players is to have the subtitles on, as this can help give clues with how you need to proceed.",1
"a very big disappointment. not at all like the first two, which were great games. pretty much took away everything that made the games good, and dished out this turd.",0
start game get into match. guy starts screeming left left right - right left and im just like wait up i have to start the car first. srsly wtf,0
nice. played it on the amiga . was fun then still is original was better in that classic way tho.,1
"a very nice game. love the decade they have chosen clues are interesting to find and you really need to pay attention, to the alibi and story of the characters. nicely done on the voices as well. out of would be a out of , but the story sometimes lacks detail and if i purchase a game on steam, i would love to play it on steam, without rockstar social club bs.",1
i've been trying to get this game working for hours. i'm not going to buy a ubisoft game for full price again. if i cant even get the game to launch then it's obvious that this game will not be worth the money i spent on it.,0
"poker night is a good time waster if you got nothing to do or, some times in my case, waiting for the internet to got back up.",1
"the game itself, not great. the gist is that it's a puzzle game that use's logic, yet you're given multiple options and there only tend so to be one option in the first place. as well as that, the game is clunk, choppy and blocky. i'm aware that a game doesn't have to have fantastic graphics to be good, however i don't enjoy playing a game that is generally just ugly. this game is bad, it should feel bad, and it's future children should feel bad. don't buy this game.",0
"shortest yet cutest game i've ever played. amazing music, adorable art style, and the story just draws you in. play it. it's worth it.",1
cool guys don't look at explosions!,1
the community is borderline annoying.,0
"this game will probably make you mess your pants. not that im saying i messed my pants, its just that its-- well, there was this one part where i came clo-- no, no, no, its just really scary is all.. and then when the water- ok, fine. the game made me mess my pants.",1
"at minutes per story, which are not even finished, i absolutely regret owning this game. with no semblance of challenge, progress is dull and despite the all star cast of voice actors the game struggles to be enjoyable in an appreciable way. would refund if it were possible.",0
this game is especially excellent.,1
missed three shots at accuracy in a row followed by a miss and then the game froze all in one mission great experience so far,0
great game would buy again,1

one of the best games i enjoyed with my firneds,1
this game is an abomination ! total disappointment at every turn.,0

"mess of a game, just absolute chaos.",0
i have skipped meals to keep playing this game. it's incredibly addicting. this is the best you can spend right now. i cannot wait for the expansion. the creators did a fantastic job with this game.,1
"it's a fun action packed play of be the good guy or the bad. how can you not love it,",1
beware this 'standalone expansion' is really a unit pack in disguise.,0
hard to believe this is a tower-defense game. most notable thing about this is the ability to rotate the orbits that have your defending crap.,1
really a gre stealth game.i would recommend it to anyone who is stealth gaming fan.and checkout the new game aragami it is slightly inspired by this game only.,1
very dull game.. map variety but all gamemodes are a like and the maps are almost identical in all ways except visually.,0

"suffers the same problems all moba's suffer. weapon balancing, minor but annoying bugs, and a developer studio that's constantly down sizing. with that said, it's a fun game, even better when you and a friend are playing on the same server and same faction. best part of planetside ? no russians or brazilians on the american and eu servers. still have to deal with network lag.",1
"player class based shooter, not many people play it now that some time has passed. the levels are unique and are fun and each class brings it's own strategy.",1

"played as a survivor. trying to start a generator. miss the skill check, boom! here comes the killer. chase ensues. puckered up like im living a horror movie. now that i have played a bit, i have to say, the lobby issues need to be addressed. not being able to play with friends in ranked, or fill a friends lobby with other non friends is . additionally, there are spots on the map where the killer and survivor can run around and around and the killer never catch them. people are exploiting this. it has also become too easy for a survivor now that people have learned the game. amending original review to out of until this is fixed.",0
"for anyone with good reflexes and a taste for ultra-violence, good music, and retro graphics. read no further - go buy the game. don't even wait for a sale. if you have slow reflexes, or bad coordination however or if you simply dislike difficult games - this game is really not for you. in my own case despite having terrible coordination over all, i managed to grind my way to level before giving up. this is not the games fault, but merely a lack of the required ability to finish it. the game has thousands of reviews into the overwhelmingly positive category - so i think it's safe to add a thumbs down for casuals and the slower reflexed among us to be wary about spending your money. i would recommend checking out a gameplay video or trying it on someone's family account before buying it yourself. the difficulty is pretty steady from level on so you can get a good taste for it pretty quickly.",0

"played it on gamecube. played it on wii. played it on pc. this game changed resident evil and even if you don't like the new ones, this is just amazing. like in other games the basic gameplay stays the same but the environment and enemies vary in a nice and exciting way. dependent on the difficulty you choose, the game achievs the true meaning of survival horror. you don't your pants but you may run like 'oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!'. sometimes your companion can be annoying but most of the time he she moves smarter than companions in other games. the checkpoints are kindly placed, so you can try to start the game on normal mode, even if you don't feel brave enough. there isn't a huge selection of weapons but later in the game you can choose between different pistols and rifles, which is a perfect amount for me. all in all this game is pure fun. there are no gamebreaking bugs i didn't experienced any bugs at all and the gameplay is fluent no long loading screens, boring things et cetera . i recommend to play this game with a controller.",1

thank you so much for this game! now i know how you do it! i will try it in real like this today.,1
"in theory this game should be good. the combat and movement system is fun. however, the game is not balanced at all. magic characters tear through enemies like butter while might characters struggle to provide any kind of usefulness. so, you end up just having a party of mostly magic characters so that the game isn't a horrible struggle. if the game wasn't so magic-biased it would be much better.",0

how can anyone say anything positive about this piece of . its better to auto resolve every battle. units dont listen to command. half a unit wil move forward a miniute later the rest will follow. if they have the oppertunity to shoot they just stand still and do nothing most of the time. my general had half a battle map to run form the enemy but instead he chose to dance in the air while being charged. not listening to any commands. wtf,0

"i'm sure this would be a great game, if only it would let me play it properly. first thing i did when i opened the game was to go to the options menu and look for the video settings. nope, can't do, game crashes. apparently this is a common problem. ok, fine, let's leave the video settings as they are. when the game started, i thought it was cool that it lets you switch between first person and third person view. when in third person, it moves like the old resident evil games, which i loved back in the day.. playing with keyboard? frustrating as hell. the controls are very unresponsive, and non-intuitive. the game looks nice, and it's interesting, it makes me mad that i can't enjoy it because the broken controls. also, seeing that is uses securom for activating the game, so that is gonna be bothersome too when installing in another system.",0

"considering the fact that i'm probably going to look exactly like wolf when i'm older, this game was interesting for me. pros amazing game to play with your friends, lots of diversity, but some repetition as is needed . i found myself enjoying the stealth just as much as the loud shooter missions. cons the year is . this game still has too many bugs and quirks that need to be fixed. dlc is amazing yes we get it, but what's the point when you have guards seeing across the map, stealth meters that freak out etc. out of because there's just a few things needing fixing, and the update with micro-transactions and skins offering stats. unacceptable. disclaimer i have not played the game since the inception of micro-transactions. however, based on the reviews and comments of other people in the world on this update from overkill, i must say i'm very dissappointed with the direction of this game. going the way of cs go and tf is a huge bust for this game. very saddening indeed.",0
holy .. why i always crashing,1
seems strange at first but becomes very addicting. i really love the accuracy and attention to detail.,1
i'm enjoying the game myself. not sure what others who posted here were expecting for . its not like you were going to get a full retail game the size of saints row for less than half the price. i'd highly recommend to any saints row fan with the common sense to realize what you are getting and what you are paying. just have to shake my head at some of these reviews who are rating the game down based on their lack of understanding.,1
"this game is stupid, it tries to pass off ridiculously scripted levels as challenge when really it's just rote memorization and stupid timing. the controls stink, it's impossible to feather a jump. you either don't move forward at all during a jump or you jump full lenght, no half jumps. it's just frustratingly stupid in the end, no point in playing it. it could be a great game if levels and enemies were more random, there were difficulty settings, the jumping controls were better and there was more loot or skills to customize your experience. not every game has to be an rpg, but this one is like a poor version off an arcade game.",0

"after the first or minutes, i immediatly was set in an immersive world full of characters on a large plane. i enjoyed exploring the crew and was eager to do things. the combat in this game is mediocre but functional, regardless though it hardly matters since it is such a small portion of the game. spoilers ahead, but they are required to understand why i am thumbing this down. i did not mind at all the idea of being an interdimensional traveller who is apparently prophesized to kill a boatload of people. however, the last minutes or so was spent in some kind of.. i haven't the slightest clue. just as i was about to close the game and go to bed, i met john and worked out his predicament. imagine my dissapointment when it rolls credits. i am not kidding. in fact, the game tells me to specifically break the th wall in the sequel, assuming it comes out. so let's review. a completly immersion breaking ending, asking me to break the th wall, hours of total gameplay, and we have consortium.",0

"well i have to say, while hg is a well made game, it simply lacks the same level of team work and intensity of day of infamy. hg has a lot of potential to be made into the free to play ww game and so far it does not feel like a battle simulation but a oversized counter strike. what do i meant by that ? . by allowing soldiers to deploy all over the map instead of in waves, hg lacks the motivation to play as a team and does not feel like an intense military game. in day of infamy soldiers dies like flies but it is a lot of fun. . games like day of infamy has officers, who has to work with the radio soldier to call in orders or arty, it again encourages team play while make the game more realistic. . for a game that should be free, paying players are overpoweredl. it would be nice to at least give the free players better anti tank weapons. . it is stupid to give soldiers hp points, it makes again the paying players more advantaged given their automatic weapons.",0

"'i am pain and that is truth' yes you are. to say this game is evil would be more accurate than it would be to say the game is about split second timing, but i did have some fun with it, though probably still far from beating it. challenging platform-hell puzzle games like these are a real treat, not so much the gameplay but the feeling of satisfaction when you can finally advance, even if that satisfaction is shortlived once you get stuck at the next level. it's no super-meatboy clone, but that in itself is why i like it. just about my only legitimate complaint about this game is that it doesn't feature a stage select. not that big a deal but i would like to go back and see if i got that quote right.",1

"where to even start! the voice acting is incredible, not many people ever give actors much credit in reviews if any. graphically the game is a step up, next gen games are looking very vivid, and running very smooth. all of the areas have so much to look at, tons of ground clutter, and so many awesome secrets to explore at the same time. the crafting system, and most other elemets stayed the same from the game. which is totally fine, because it worked very well. i'm only a few hours into the game and i'm totally in love with everything about it. the appealing female has nothing to do with it . it's on sale right now, so if you don't have this game in your library it needs to be put into it. exploration, explosions, and ancient ruins! honestly i don't see this formula getting old at any point, seeing as i'm going to school for archaeology anthropology. not that it's going to be anywhere near this exciting, but it sure gets the blood flowing! game gets a out of from me!",1
"so, my friend got this game for free from the dev for me for whatever reason , and.. well, i could talk about the fact that it looks and plays like it was just created in an hour, but i've got something different. when i tried playing this the first time, i had to close the game shortly afterwards iirc, there was something wrong with it's launch . after this, i could not launch the game because it's .exe file was missing. even after verifying the files several times, the .exe just kept mysteriously vanishing. after asking the dev why i couldn't get the .exe to stay, he suggested i re-install the game which worked , and i had the wonderful pleasure of playing such a wonderfully broken game note i played before the patch was launched but i can't because the .exe is missing again anyways , so it might be better in some slight way? . but this was back on july th, so why am i writing a review now? because i found all of the .exe's today. in the avast virus chest . it made my day, but i still wouldn't recommend the game.",0

the strategy element in this game fells really broken. it doesn't feel like strategy at all. most of the time you are clicking unit building button times to create units to later see that enemy harvester non military resource gathering unit accidentally just drives through them and kills all them by the way the harvester has more hp than most military units so even with huge army killing it before is hard and micromanaging your units out of its way also is almost impossible in most situations . some said it is similar to 'command and conquer generals' but in my opinion it isn't even close.,0

"game wouldn't start when dxtory was open, after opening i realised it actually isn't remotely scary then closed it after hour play. gave it a good try, but i've played games which aren't based entirely around horror which have gave me more scares than this game. it also has some serious fps issues, stuttering and stuff. i didn't even pay for it and i want my money back, out of .",0
tyranny is a very good game. the story is defintely interesting perhaps more than pillars of eternity and the combat is decent not great . the only two things that i really didn't like are the setting i would have liked to see more variety and the difficulty. i played this game in hard mode and i would say just the first few hours were challenging.,1
"transistor is a unique game from a unique studio. the combat has strategic depth while also being open to a run and gun style. the story really pulled me in, but not quite as much as the world building. i honestly wanted to see more of the world that the game presented me. as always with supergiant games, the sound was one of the best gaming experiences i have ever had. tl dr short quick story driven game. play it.",1
this game sucks dont get it save ur money for something else dont make the mestake that i made,0
hammerwatch is an amazing hack and slash gauntlet type game for up to players. not to mention that it also comes with a level editor.,1
nice relaxing way of playing mahjong. although i'm not a fan of the timer but it does help try to get the player to speed through to collect those items they need for quests. it's a fun game.,1
"game was great up until you meet the enemies called beserkers they are gamebreakingly bad designed, they got a glowing part in the back you have to shoot ive emptied weapons in them always at a time and they are not dying only i am , im playing on casual mode and so far its the only part in the game ive ever died, i think ill just give up after a few tries more, cant recomend this game cause of them.",0
the learning curve is pretty steep and becomes frustrating. there is also no undo button so if you mess up building something then you've just wasted money. i came into this expecting something similar to sim city but more focused on public transport. i left disappointed and feeling like i needed a degree in order to play the game properly.,0
"i haven't really tried this game single player, but i can say that it is pretty enjoyable to play with friends. things usually get pretty hectic, but in a goofy fun sort of way, especially if you are not using any sort of voice chat and just trying to imagine what your co-conspirators actions will be.",1

"i can see that a lot of effort was put into this game but i feel betrayed because of the false advertisment that was intentionally or unintentionally broadcasted by the youtubers and streames as 'the better version of isaac'. i stopped playing the game after hours not because it was hard oh and it is hard at first! , but becasue it needs full atention at all times and the type of controls that it uses. i confess i have almost k hours in isaac, but even in the beginning i was fun and a relaxed game for me. as i heard from my friends, it has a steep learing curve and it flattens and then it is rng that if you get a good gun you can just win the game. long story short this game has nothing to do with isaac and please stop comparing it with it.",0
best city builder ever played.,1
"it's fairly fun, it's got a fairly good story, but if you're looking for doom doom, you're better off going way oldschool or getting the brand spanking new one. this doom plays more like a horror graphic novel than a genuine doom game. bit disappointing.",0
one of my most favorite game series of all time,1
for some reason the right analog stick moves the character. could not find an option to undo this problem..,0
possibly the best game i have ever played!,1

looks like and early access game,0
the game is really simple and slow. only times of things and very limited strategy.,0
"hard start. i do not recommend this game except for the visual detail of futuristic city. however, lack of story in a shooter means losing a lot of points in my view. bulletstorm, which i am playing now it is funnier and it has some degree of story.",0

culture rich game. another great game with smooth amp easy platformer puzzle.,1
i had so much fun with this game i have played hours until now i have had some great moments in this just cause came out about a month ago and i have had very much fun in that too this franchise is one of my favorite,1
"total, absolute,unworthy of my money garbage. and i'll tell you why. since patching to . the game reset itself and put me right back to the begining of the game. hours of game play and everything that goes along with that amount of time put in gone. after reinstalling the game for a second time it's quit working, rd fresh install has had the same results. i've contacted hello games about this and received no answer, steam refuses to refund my money, reason being is that you only get hours to decide wether a game is worth your money or not. hours in no man's sky just about gets you off the starter planet. so far i have asked steam for a refund times, i've even called valve and left a message. so whatever you do do not buy this game. i was super excited about this release only to be, for want of a better word, robbed.",0
"dishonored is one of those games that starts out being pretty popular but gradually wanes in popular discussion. i think it's a fantastic game that, despite the bugs that preeminently exist in all bethesda games everywhere and for all time, is worth the time to play through it. there's a kind of morality system that affects how dark and brooding the end cinematic is, but that's the only thing you'd ever need to worry about as far as endgame is concerned. each mission is fairly self-contained, leaving you only to worry about the specific goals of that arc of the story. and the game's got gimmicks. but they're good gimmicks that are there for the whole game and serve a useful purpose. the dark powers your character can use let you teleport, turn invisible, see through walls, call up rats to eat people, etc., and it adds a whole new dimension to the standard 'sneak your way from one end of the map to the other' missions.",1
ive only minutes in and it laggs so much the only thing thats on time is the audio,1
"words cannot express how furious i am feeling right now.. i've recently bought the game even though i know there were many issues but i was like 'hey, maybe ill be one of the lucky ones experiencing little issues with the game'click..click..click. - from wallet. finally done installing it and excited to try out the game. menu loaded, click new game..loading..'saving game' pops up top right corner.. seconds later, 'acu.exe has stopped working' pops up. reloaded the game and tried again but same outcome. ing i hate myself as much as i hate ubisoft. want my ing money back but i guess i had it coming.. me and my stupidity..sighhh. to those of you that haven't bought the game yet, pleaseeee pleaseee dont be like me and buy this unfinished game for . not ing worth it if you cant play it. just wait till they fix all the issues and even then do not buy it!! let others who already have the game test it out first before you spend on this game.",0

don't buy this if you are intending on making games.,0
"just started to play this game. i got it a while back with the other two games, and i planned to play it after i beat the two. this week, i said 'screw it' and began. and oh my god, this is amazing. with only hours under my belt, i'm already drawn into the world of bioshock infinite, from the interesting plot to the dynamic atomsphere, it feels like a real city in the sky. just get it already! i haven't even played through it completely and i'm recommending it to you! i suggest getting it with the other two games during a steam sale, as the price drops quite a bit. if you like fps games, but want more plot and atomsphere, then this is your game. there is more than enough adrenaline-pumping action believe me there is! and enough sections to just pause and look at the scenery. again, there is no reason not to get this game. out of .",1
its the only relevant fighting game so i guess you have to buy it huh edit nvm,0
the best fo the best game bro,1
this game is excellent but about a quarter through i encounted a glitch where the camera would just spas out everywhere and not following lara making the game unplayable. i have tryed re-installing and it didn't fix.,0

created in hours - i realized,0

"if you liked enemy unknown, then you'll probably really like xcom . if you didn't, then the changes made in this game probably won't change your mind. if you haven t played enemy unknown, then maybe give that a try first. i have run into enough technical problems, bugs, crashes, etc., that i'd recommend against playing on ironman right now. i ve had enemies that i can t target despite being right next to them, characters that have gotten stuck in a prone animation and then teleport around, and enemies that have remained floating in the air after getting caught in an overwatch animation. so far it s been nothing a quick load of an older save won t fix, but i d be really frustrated if i couldn t do that.",1
if you love rpg's then this would be a good place to start,1
don't worry about my in game time. i've clocked the game way back when and it was awesome. this review is just to let you know that it is playable on win . but you need a fix from the internet for that. the opening soundtrack is the best! wish there was an album.,1
"this is anything but a game. it has no story to interact with so there is no narrative to save it from that conclusion. this thing is impossible to lose because quite literally anything you do will only lead to you eventually gaining money. there is no point. you will gain money into extremely high numbers and in return you get nothing. you have not beaten a difficult challenge. you have not expieirienced a great story. you have clicked on some buttons a few times and admired some nice art similar to that of fallout. this is the type of game a person would play if they hate losing. one which requires very little thought and in return for the small effort you put in, you see a big number on your screen which is nice. a cookie clicker clone. if you have any self respect, you would play an actual game instead of wasting your time with this cancer.",0
"it's a great game but the title is misleading. the main character is not an octopus. he is a very polite, yet clumsy, man in a suit.",1
i too prefer my pork rare.,1
"waste of time and money this game, wish i had never bought it.",0
"a little short but really so hillariously funny, a very entertaining comedy snack",1
"was a good game, untill they made it so you have to log into origin to play, now it's an unplayable piece of crap that sits in my game library.",0
"the static speaks my name is not scary, not fun, not artistic, not edgy, barely a game, not funny, short, low quality and all round bad. the graphics are awful, which yes don't always matter but when your game is minutes long and about a minute of that is taken up by pressing g and h, both of which have no effect on the game. the story is about the main character obsessing over a painting, this is never explained as to why, i've played through three times to try and sus it oout, yet nothing is there. anyway there's a guy in a cage presumably the artist of the painting and the story asks you to do something with him you can a unlock his cage or b elecrocute him either way it makes no difference the man stays exactly the same and never moves or makes a noise. so all in all the games awful, it's linear and has no replay value, just get no room in hell or something it's scarier and free.",0
"this game has proved itself. great humor, awesome combat. this game is great. if you have dollars lying around and have nothing else to do. i highly suggest this game to any wolfenstein fans. this game shows what the world would be like if the nazis had won.",1

"unfortunately, i cannot review the game, only the download amp patch process. this is bad. i have triedmultiple times every day for the last week to download and patch this game, but failed. i have no difficulty with any other internet game at all as far as download amp patch, or play, and my internet is working fine. i downloaded the initial game fine, but the patch always freezes up at some point in the middle of file out of . i couldn't find where anyone has written about this issue, so i went to the nf site for support. while trying to create an account with them, the anti-robot box would never accept my answers. and last i checked, i'm not made of metal. so i couldn't create an account either. huge dissapointment, because after looking at the screenshots and videos, i was really looking forward to playing the game and possibly trying to gets some friends in it too.",0

video review - definitely recommended. great game! youtube video the red solstice review and gameplay nbsp,1

"ehhhhhhhhhhh.. it's okay. i'm a huge fan of the bone comic's and i've read all of them at least fifty times. so, trust me, there are noticeable differences. otherwise, this is an okay adaptation. the characters look and sound as i thought they would excpt fone bone . most of the animations are pretty good. the graphics are really pretty. it's rather short. again, they cut out a lot. the gameplay puzzle portions are boring and just there to be there. and it was clearly ment for smaller children, and we all know how well it goes when telltale games tries to make a game for kids minecraftstorymode ! i think anyone older than the intended age would find this to be rather boring. otherwise, if you're a huge bone fan like me and want to play a game about it, i reccomend it. but, it's not worth it if you havn't read all the books yet. one other thing i should note is that there is another bone game in developement that will adapt all the books on gamejolt for free. i recommend checking that one out.",1
"insane crits from monsters, damage spikes, hp armor stat being useless, and having to play a certain way or else you die. game is somewhat unplayable past a certain difficulty level. would not recommend playing past veteran difficulty unless you're a masochist and enjoy dying constantly. honestly if you're going to get torchlight stay away from the second and only get the first. the first game is a heck of a lot more enjoyable than this garbage.",0

"i've been playing this since , and added it to steam not that long ago, so i have much more hours than this account shows i do. it was amazing at the beginning, but it has become worse every patch. it has a really good potential, but its lack of balance, the amount of time you have to put into it to unlock a vehicle, the developers moders etc that do not listen to the community and some other things, just do not allow me to recommend the game. if you want a good combat flight tank simulator, look somewhere else.",0
"bought this game when it came out, i think for . i bought it caus the first part was fun. the campaign took me hours after that i played some of the campaign again and some of the challenge mode, another , hours. now after duno how long i wanted to play this game again, here is one of the problems, i can't start the game. it crashes when i start it, sometimes it will start but if i 'tab-out' it crashes. i can't play this game checked the forums and it seems i'm not the only one who has this problem. i also can't recommend it because of its low playtime, hours for the first play thru! and i dosnt even have replayability caus its boring as f k. you have the same boss times. the same enemies over and over and all you have to do is smash one button for most of it. so yeah if you can get this game for free get it play it for - hours, if you have to pay for it dont get the first part its better in evry point.",0
lol bought this game for under and was keen to play it. have tried numerous times now to find a match but have failed to find a single person. the games dead and you would be stupid to buy it at this point. its a shame because it had a bad intro and seemed like a lot of fun. guess i should be playing overwatch like everybody else,0
"devs are unable to create an equal playing field for both parties. every patch is either in favour for survivors or killers. as of november , the game is now broken to the limit due to the perk 'decisive strike'. the devs just seem to never be able to get it right and with all the bugs in this game, i do not believe they play test their own games either. if you're into a game that makes it easy to grief other players through teabagging, and other dbd terminology such as infinities, then sure, play it. however, the community is toxic and you won't feel powerful and dominant as you play the killer.",0

"contracts was my introduction to the hitman series, and the creative license we were given to complete the job was the gift that kept on giving. depending on the weather, one could opt to be professional and keep things quiet or go on a sterling archer-esque rampage. absolution, however, decides to take that agency away and puts you in the uncomfortably tighter suit of a restrictive narrative, much like your mother did when you were flower boy at your uncle gerald's wedding. unfortunately, the aforementioned narrative is done in disappointingly poor taste, and absolution's linear nature does not lend itself well to multiple replays. filled with ghoulish, hideous caricatures which are supposed to pass some semblance of human beings, absolution catapults you into the grungy abyss of a metaphorical and at one point literal sex dungeon. it remains a competent stealth-action game and there's certainly some fun to be had if you're truly, desperately bored..but try as you might, you can't wash the smell of grindhouse out long after you've left.",0

"aweful game. got to a section of the city where there seems to be bombs randomly placed in the street. hit one and you car blows up, failing your mission. the mission structure is terrible and you can waste half an hour only to have the game freak out and kill you for a random reason and you have to start again. there are numerous places where you could checkpoint the levels but it doesn't. it just becomes unfair and horribly unfair to play. it's painfully reminiscent of gta iii which i just gave up on because of tedious levels. man they just didn't learn.",0
"great game until the end. the story had many nice twists in it, but it didn't ever capitlise on any of them, instead leaving the ending a very boring bland pile of 'meh'. the main reason you go out there is never truly resolved, nor is what happens after. if the game is set in the past, surely we could at least get a flash forward ending to show how everything played out, our decisions paying off or having concequences. sadly, it ignores every good idea to end up being a very beautiful, very atmospheric, very well voice acted, very boring story. edit wait til it drops in price. at under , i recommend this game.",0

if you have friends i urge you to get this game. hardcore mode is infuriating in a group. out of would fire arrows at a friends head again.,1
"this game was a cash grab when it came, trying to make money of the concept of block games and also zombie games. releasing early dlcs only to make some fast money for a game that wasn't even finished to begin with. now it's a near dead game, but not only that. it isn't even a good or fun game. the zombiemode can be decent, but that's all. overall, this game is a trainwreck that you should avoid. a few servers still up as of out of , so you can play the multiplayer, but you wonder for how long. tldr don't buy. crap game.",0
"everyone out there, just stop complaing about this game performance ok? not all of us have the issues you have mentioned plus i'll let you have it this way the story is awesome, telltale is doing a great job as usual and they are the best low-profit game company out there! why do you even complain? just give them time and they'll optimize the game later on, but it is not necessay, the game it's playlable and enjoyable as hell in its current shape.",1

"this game feels like the developers have just watched the excellent trading places and said, 'wouldn't it be great if we louis dan aykroyd the managers, you know, just for a laugh? but keep turning the screw until it breaks.' it seems to defeat the enjoyment to be had in playing strategy management type games, of meeting challenges, learning to cope and turn events around to hopefully win, when the ai decides to take over and throw all your carefully crafted work out the window for the rest of a season. you're no longer in charge, and the game is no longer a game but a series of disheartening events. welcome to football manager",0
the core idea of the game borrowed from kane amp lynch fragile alliance is great but the execution is really lacking. playing offline with bots is a no-go as they don't have the slightest bit of intelligence. playing online involves several minutes of load time even on modern spec ssd computers and even just for another player to join everyone is stalled and have to wait for minutes. go play kane amp lynch fragile alliance instead.,0
"unfortunately, i can't recommend this game for pc. it simply cannot run on my system - i'm using windows . i don't know if it's any other programs i'm running that somehow fiddles with the game and causes it to freeze so bad i have to reboot my computer.. but either way, it's completely ridiculous and i can't recommend the game. is new vegas crashy too? fall out is gonna get forgotten by the next generation of gamers if these issues continue!",0
im in love with this game,1
"game is enjoyable, and beautifully made. don't just run in and act a hero, you've got to be strategic. understandable that it's a game not for everyone. but, just explore and check out how well they made nyc. always better with friends!",1
this game isnt very good at the start when i played i did not know what to do. once i found out that i had to make my own realm all .you can do is just work on it. theres no point.,0

cool puzzle game. it's extremely challenging and convoluted in some places though.,1
"maybe some games are poorly optimized for pc and have cpu bottlenecking issues after the first area. maybe some games tell a slightly different story from the initial trailers. so what? rise of the tomb raider is a game with a decent story and gameplay. if you like the tomb raider franchise you should play it. the game humanizes lara again, but not as much as tr did, making her a wimp. this time lara is back, and committed to her quest. until she gets distracted with collecting every single relic she comes across. definitely recommended",1
very very good puzzle game!,1
"miles jacobson said that if si can sell in china, si will add the chinese. but he didn't fulfill his promis. so we must give this game a low score couse of thers is no chinese version in game.",0
"as sad as it is,i can't in good conscious ever recommend this game after the monumental changes. sure, the weapons got rebalanced, but seemingly rebalanced to encourage people to dump endless amounts of money in their new cs go crate system in order to get rare and powerful stat buffs. i'm willing to wait till the end of crime fest, but after that i'm probably out.",0
"i'm not a fan. to be fair, i'm not a big platformer guy anyway. i was hopeful due to generational and rogue-like aspects, but no, it's still grind the same thing over and over again. in spite of all the other features this game is first and foremost a platformer. probably good for die-hard fans of platformers.",0
do not buy this game. it's an touchscreen microtransaction game that the devs are claiming was originally for pc. amusing for -.. definitly not worth .,0
i died in a level so i'm going to leave a negative review,0

"the joy of exploration, the thrill of the fight, the weight of your every decision and so much more. ftl has many levels of enjoyment catering to different play styles and different players, it is definitely a game that most will enjoy. while it isn't exactly a fast pace classic space shooter, the combat system is more dynamic and a breath of fresh air too. it is very replayable as each ship has its own unique style and bonuses that change how you handle your game entirely. the different events that occur in each play through constantly keeps the game fresh. a highly recommmended game to play.",1
out of would game over on the first level again.,1
"did you saw the anime? that it's garbage if you compare it to the vn, it's that good. so get it. and if you didn't saw it. get it anyways, it's a really good story and also has interesting mechanics. it's like phoenix wright but with more chaos since it isn't really a court.",1
what a fantastic game. only problem is i never want to replay it again.. i couldn't do that to them.,1
it's too much work and i'm too lazy. maybe if i knew just the only things i needed to do to know the story i'd have given it another try. it doesn't immerse me from the start and i'm impatient,0
"i gotta say that this game is very enjoyable to kill some time and is a great lego game. pros rpg style of adventure -many characters to play -can start levels at different points -save and exit feature is really nice -all-around a fun game to play cons the rpg style they made super repetitive -there are so many random cinematics that just seem to old time. these random cinematics are unskippable and are very annoying as they pop-up every two minutes. these make the game unbearable at points. -pretty much the entire game is designed for two people because you need to switch between characters for every single mission over and over. this game is not worth the money whatsoever, i managed to get this game for off and is the only time you should ever buy this game. just seemed like they added content just because they needed more content, and not because it made the game more fun in any way. i 'd this game and it took me about hours, maybe less, being easily avoidable if you play two player which is a slap in the face for a solo player like me.",0
theres no fullscreen. i like my games in fullscreen,0
"as it is, it is an unbalanced, near unplayable mess. i can clearly see the potential, but there is more to gaming that powerful enemies and poor starts. unfortunately, after deaths and no progress, i gave it up in disgust. the enemies are too powerful for the start of the game. even with the dog, you will only die painfully. hunger and thirst are so poorly balanced that you can die of dehydration in less than a day of doing nothing. loot is almost non-existant. in of my four runs, i got only one ranged weapon and ammo for it at the same time. most of the containers were empty, and the only food item i found was meat. no water means that you will not stand a chance. this is not a complete game. it should have gone on early access instead of being put out at full price. i hope the developers learn from their mistakes and make this game playable, because as it is i cannot enjoy it. there is a difference between a hard uet fun game, and an unfair and unplayable game.",0
"don't listen to these people saying you need a top tier gun to win. i know i just got it, but i've been playing on a firends computer and watching many people play it. if you just pick up a rogue like, such as gungeon, you will not win for a long time. if you would like to compare it to isaac, do you need brimstone or moms knife to win every run? no. you must learn game mechanics in order to win, you could beat the game with the starting weapon if you learn the mechanics. just buy it and have fun.ad",1
"i am a big fan of the old kq games -- namely kq amp kq . i recommend it at the price i purchased it -- . during the steam winter sale. if you want the feel of the old kq style games, this is a bit different. it's more of a story than a puzzle. but for ., i can say i recommend it.",1
warframe is a good game.,1
"ok, so i really wanted to enjoy this game because it seemed like it would just be a funny experience.. i bought this game almost years ago and am only getting back to it now after playing for about minutes.. the game is not very good in terms of the controls, the physics, the mechanics, and bascially there is nothing good i can say about this game at all.. it's not really fun, it's way to difficult to do the most basic tasks, and you cant even change the camera angle from what i know. i feel like the developper of this game was really in the mood to make just some sort of sick joke on the people who actually paid money for this game.. and in reality, he or she succeeded. out of one point for each dollar the game is worth.",0
doesnt work with win .,1
"it's a great game but what saddens me is there is no official sandbox mode, you actually have to go in, make your own map mode to play and set how much money you want, etc.",1

i had a miscarage playing this game. borderlands ed us over. the rd one killed it.,0
not cool after half an hour,0
pros - solid gameplay. - online works well. - relatively balanced characters. - game is pretty easy to start playing. cons - mileage may vary. heavily dependent on how dedicated you are to playing in a box. - taunting personal hatred - playing game with people who know what they're doing can be very disheartening. would i recommend this game to an ordinary person? not at all. the price is honestly insane. but would i recommend this game to a person who enjoys competitive games? yes.,0
"as a person that enjoys turn based strategy games, i'm surprised i haven't played xcom sooner in my life. this game is absolutely fantastic. from the global strategy to manage your resources and assign develop a path to victory to the combat that showcases some of the better ai in the gaming industry. this is a game that never allows you a cheap victory. every battle you win is earned.",1
"it's exactly like all the new 'open world' ea racing games. so if you like the classic ea formula with very few actual crash events.. this isn't even burnout. added insult to injury, the 'ultimate box' doesn't include all of the dlc's. it only includes of or so. it's a perfectly lukewarm game, therefore, i can not recommend it.",0
"a classic rpg in the style of eye of the beholder and other first-person rpgs from the early ' s. there's about hours of content here, and its all worthwhile. much of the game involves trap puzzles. there is no grind or repetition here -- your character will progress at a reasonable rate to match the challenges of each level, and each level offers new and interesting challenges. the game has a retro feel with modern graphics, and doesn't drag on forever like many other rpgs. much of the fun involves hunting for secrets and there are many . there's essentially no replay value here, but your first playthrough will give you more than your money's worth. there are no unskippable cutscenes to destroy the fun.",1
"jesus, i love this game so much! was playing it before it got on steam, and hell i threw euros at it right away! money well spent! buy it now, instead of buying your stupid cods!",1
"it's a platinum action game so of course the combat is incredibly fun. there are loads of weapons for you to toy with on top of different characters to play. it's feels so good to hear the destruction in combat and watch the action unfold. it's short for one playthrough about hours or less? but the replayability reminds me of viewtiful joe. while short, you will want to keep getting better and better at the game to improve your rank. even if you don't improve too much, it's still fun to beat up a bunch of robots in this manner. at the same time, you are upgrading yourself in the process in this case, weapons and stats and making the next playthrough that much better. if you played a lot of viewtiful joe, you might scratch an itch with this game. it's a feeling i haven't felt since that game. edit unlocked magnus difficulty and yep, the game gets really interesting at this point. well worth multiple playthroughs.",1
"this is a review for the third best game ever made. thanks, written by me.",1
addicting and hard.. but fun and goofy too! works for me,1

"don't download this at all. i can't even get past the registration. to simply quote someone who has gotten through. 'this kind of game has its own sub category besides wow clone. i call it, sweat shop korean mmo. it's when a korean company pushes out a low budget, graphically outdated, copy pasta game that wouldn't have impressed anyone after . the controls are just terrible. the choppy camera movement alone makes it seem like the game is running at half the speed that it actually does. the quests are cheesy and overly done. there's no depth in the combat either. like most bad mmos, it's just pressing buttons to activate skills in a certain order. there's literally nothing about this game that makes it worth playing.'",0
warning this game does not support intel hd graphic cards. if you buy this game with a intel hd graphic card then you will never get your money back because steam has the worst support then any other website has ever had.,0
"great game, controls, graphics on point. must definitely play through a second time to unlock the long war.",1
single player- amazing online- you have been hacked! online with friends- crazy d,1
i am suprised. long time i didn't play such balanced and nicely created game. i am old wargamer and i recommend this to all wargamers. it reminds me old days with steel panters ii and also panzer general a bit. there is only one thing i am not sure of. angle of view for units. sometimes it happens that i engage tanks from back or side and they are still able to see me and shoot at me. tanks have poor visibility against infantry and this factor was not really taken into account. however fantastic game.. out of . will buy also dlc megapack for sure.,1
"great game imho. i love the fighting, as simple as it may be.. gets a thumbs from me put some death metal on and have fun.. xd",1

"well written, very cute, and addicitve. like dark cloud and azure dreams before it, recettear provides a stronger and more sophisticated reason for looting than to just 'finding new stuff.' running your own shop and haggling play as much of a role as fleshing out the randomly generated dungeons. do note however that this is not an endless game. recette is attempting to earn just enough to pay off tear for her missing father's debts so that she does not find herself as shelterless as she is orphaned. damn japan must be a hard place! price recommended",1
"somehow, even though it's practically unplayable, im still having a blast. this game is so much fun. but! buy it on consoles this version barely works on my decent rig. some say its not optomized for nvidia. that definitely seems to be the case. i can hardly play it's very frustrating.",0
good visuals don't make up for annoying characters amp lame forced humor. very meh.,0
it would be great if people played it. the alpha was much better and i'm pretty disappointed,0
"terrible port, poor map design, and not even enough players to play anything but tdm need i say more?",0
the game has issues right from the get go. difficulty with resolution. on my lenovo res. yet this game with the same res is settings is about x larger. the launcher starts in the bottom right corner and wont move. very disapointed. cant even play,0
"it's time to save grandma from the clutches of evil. this follows the typical greatness that artifex mundi offers in all of its hidden object games. the graphics are great, the storyline is unnecessary, the voice acting is mediocre, but the fun of the puzzles and hidden object games are great. this game was short and fairly easy. i found the hidden object scenes weren't as typical as you would expect, while some were tough. the atypical hos were find an object, place it where it fits, which gives you another object and then find where that goes, and so on and so forth. it was a good break from the typical hos, but felt too easy. the puzzles were good, but nothing extravagant that made it too difficult to move forward. as usual easy achievements for those hunters out there. definitely recommend it if you love these types of games.",1
crashed on a boss fight. let me add my name to the list of people who experienced crashes on windows . sadness.,0
one of the best from the fallout series. i loved how you went to the oil rig platform to dispatch the president. it was a great experience to roam the wasteland in search of geck. its an dated graphical masterpiece and i consider it must play.,1
"while this game isn't perfect as there are a few bugs and minor annoyances, this is easily contrasted with the beautiful scenary, fantastic combat system and interesting story that make this a top notch game.",1
hey i pey but no working,0
"i bought this game because i expect to get the price back by selling the cards. i still gave the gameplay a try though and these are my findings upgrades are temporary, as in picking up the twin single shot cannons will give you about seconds of shooting them before going back to the single single-shot cannon. during this time however you can't pick up other weapon upgrades like the twin triple-shot cannons. some pickups give you random downgrades, as for example locking you into the horizontal or vertical axis at the point you currently are. while also temporary this can cause you to die pretty fast. overall it's a pretty bland space shooter, you go from left to right and shoot enemy ships until the level changes. now and then a boss appears but there really isn't much diversity as far as i can see. buy this if you want to sell the cards. do not buy this at full price. on the internet you can find free flash games with more depth than this.",0
unable to use iron sights. it's just another pay to win free game.. i don't reccomend it.,0
lol now if you didnt dl this before dont buy it lmao xdd,0
"used to be good, now just a pay to win",0
"everything was so random in this game it was interesting seeing how a person who planned to commit suicide might spend his last night. it was an alright game. i have no real complaits, but it would have been cool for those other grey blobs at the end to turn into other situations to play. that would be interesting.",1
"bad game , waste of time !!",0
good for a ho game. a little short but enjoyable.,1
"while i loved the original ori and the blind forest's fantastic platforming, spledid visuals and wonderful soundtrack, the combat always felt more like a chore than an enjoyable diversion from platforming. thankfully the definitive edition remedies that one major complaint, and adds several new features such as fast travel and locations. black root burrows, one of the newly added areas, is considerable in size and took me almost three hours to completely explore. it also adds some welcome backstory to the characters in the game. the overall package is a huge step up from the original game, and one that i highly recommend for anyone who loves the metroidvania genre.",1
"yes you can see it's a port of an iphone game. it's short, lifeless and tedious. you find one key to open another lock to find yet another key, repeat..seriously that's it!! if i hadn't left this game lying around in my collection untouched for so long amp purchased it during a christmas sale i would be demanding a refund - from apple!! avoid it unless you can't find you iphone and are having withdrawals",0
you can either play alone and scream in terror as zombies tear you apart or you can play with friends and scream in terror as you watch zombies tear them apart,1
the refund button works well.,0
"i remember when this game was announced and in development. i was so excited the way that they explained how you could play the game in dm mode and basically create scenarios for people to dungeon crawl through and make it easy or challenging, and then how you could control bosses and fight against adventurers. that alone was a big reason why i bought this game. then i tried to actually play a dm game. and nobody plays dm games. the online play is dead. even if you do manage to somehow find a game, if you're a fresh character you're not going to have much luck joining a game at your level, they'll always be at least levels ahead of you. granted, the offline solo campaign is decent, save for a few somewhat challenging parts. but for me alone, i bought this for the multiplayer aspect, which was a big point they were advertising. and there is no multiplayer.",0
"great sp campaign and fun multiplayer, lots of mods available to extend play too! probably the best sp campaign of all the dow games.",1
"this is the best sandbox game i have ever seen my favorate survers are the rp surevers like perp or dontown rp ec.. its up to you what ever you want to do. you can make you own surver and make it into rp,ttt, murder,prison run, etc.. anything",1
"they lied to me, there are plently alive things in this game",1
"if you like video game violence, good graphics, and have a good sense of humor, this game is perfect for you. this isn't really meant to be played to win. if you want a game to just play to have fun and enjoy, this game is the one to get.",1

this game is so laggy when i played this game i thought arma life was in the game already but this game is ed up lol jks peace p,0
this is the best star wars rpg ever made! buy it!,1
"biggest crap ever. doesn't worth any cents so far. no updates, creators don't give a about the game.in-game transactions boring repetative",0
"its good for a clicker game. put it this way, literally all you do is click the mouse button, maybe change your hair style, collect gold by moving your mouse over it unless it just does it, then idk then do that over again. you cant really change their clothes without spending money, and its literally just staring at a girl, so thats not worth it. so, only buy this game its free, but whatevs if you just want to waste time doing nothing but clicking. and you'll eventually get to a point where you dont even need to click. but then you're not even really playing. so whats the point? had to turn volume way down. moans were getting to me",0
"this game is honestly, just ordinary. thats it, its not great its not bad just.. ordinary. time mechanic good repetitiveness bad story ehhh characters but honestly, just kinda there.. wish steam had an even button instead thumbs down",0
"this game should be titled, how to hold down 'w'. the music was cool, the rest was incredibly pointless.",0
"the artwork is pretty nice, but i couldn't get past the story. i'll bullet point - i get it, one character really likes food. they order lots of food. is that this vn's comedy? - is nadia a sexual predator? she basically found some random almost-naked girl on the street and her first response is to drag her to a movie and back to her place while giving no alternative sleeping arrangements. even though it's fantasy, i was just like 'um, ok?' - forced innuendo. i get it already. the game's going for the yuri audience. - a visual novel joke at an arcade? i know you're trying to be meta, but it was an extended joke in the wrong place. - i know there was the big page sprawl about rock and roll but like i just chuckled at the whole epiphany part where she suddenly draws out a guitar and it's like what's happening is a given even though her sister is using monsters to attack her and not any music. it's just like.. what's going on? i played up to there. i don't really want to play any more.",0
"most of the community is hilarious, and add to the hilarity wth addons!",1
awesome game really funny and enjoyable,1
"probably one of the most immersive and difficult fpses i've ever played. it's actually pretty surprising this came out of a big production company like ubisoft. the graphics are a little dated now, and the enemy respawn distance is straight out of the nes era, but if you can get past these minor issues, this game is very rewarding.",1
"it is amazing, i recommend playing it if you like side-scrolling mmorpgs with a pretty small, but unique selection of characters to pick from.",1
"this game is ok at best, very limited controlls, extremely repeditive, overall i was bored with it,",0
it's a great game to play with friends.. before you lose them. ps the ui and ost got replaced since the beta.. for the worst.,1
me and my friends play this game too much.,1
like this game very very much,1
"it is a very fun game and i would buy it fold. but the developers are unfair and honestly are horrible. after a promissed introduction to payday that there would be no dlc, guess what there is? dlc!",0
crashes on relese. getting really sick of games that get realeased without working. feel ripped off. miss the good ol days,0
"this game is sorta fun, but it pushes many of the cons the elite in the real world are trying to push on us. it is an agenda pusher in my opinion. some of the mechanics are make believe like global warming and terrorism. the only terrorists are the government funded ones. it takes big bucks to finance a personal terrorist army. the only people with big bucks to spend on that would be the governments themselves and the elite. if it did not have the propaganda included it would be a fun game. the mythological aspects added to it are what ruined it for me.",0
"awesome,just awesome,but none of my computer can run it it wont play and one is a alienware.",0
"truly cinematic in scope exceptional storyline, beautiful environments, superlative acting. with very few negatives, the primary is the lack of a first-person perspective option, as the off-centre third-person camera angle feels like driving a three-wheeled shopping cart. also, the characters look a little cross-eyed at times. recommended playing environment dead of night, lights off, headphones on, home alone. see if you don't start looking over your shoulder while you play. - skinny from the fat b stard curator link",1
"good pixel art boring dialogs dull gameplay. if you want to play something similar, try broforce, hotline miami, super time force ultra or super crate box.",0
"probaly one of my favorite games i have ever played, i recomend for people who like gta and saints row and just like to around in open world games",1
really great. would love a season .,1
the only problem with this games is that its called resident evil. they re only cashing on the name of the franchise right now. still it holds its own against the classics eventhough there s no zombies to kill..if it wasnt tied down to the res story and characters would have much more to offer. if you catch it on sale its a must!,1
"it'a a interesting concept and addicting in the beginning, but after a while it gets extremely boring.",0
going down the same path as tf and cs go sadly.. microtransactions for more profit then the game will become f p when they get enough money.,0
"out of a literal masterpiece. you will want gb of ram, an ssd, a newer i , and a video card with minimum gb of vram to enjoy this game near max graphics. a masterpiece of video gaming as we know it. nothing else can be said. a masterpiece.",1
when it is not crashing it is an amazing game.,1
game in general is great but this steam version is glitchy as hell. crashing all the time. don't buy it here.,0
"if this was a mod, valve probably bought this already.",1
this game gave me so much feelings that i probably have feeling cancer by now. out of would do chemotherapy for this game again.,1
"good game, get addicting if you like pure skill games. current state isn't great for new players as its full of hackers etc but deca games is taking over the out of so it will be intresting to see what happens. still worth the play",1
"i bought this game in hopes that it would be a decent platforming puzzle game. i was thoroughly dissapointed. this game is very boring, and leaves a lot to be desired. there is no music, and the sound that this game does give you is plain and uninspired. the controls are terrible, and you often will find yourself jumping when you mean to swing. the controls are also on the arrow keys and control key, which is not a comfortable arrangement. the art style is supposedly unique, but it looks to me like something an 'edgy' middle schooler doodled in their pre-pre-pre-pre algebra class. would not recommend.",0
"overall, the game is full of fun.. but, the big problem in this game is it's server.. not worth any penny and not recommended until the server is fixed which will never be",0
"this is a cheap cash grab. mara jade doesn't play any differently from kyle, the storyline is boring, the levels are badly designed, and the live action cutscenes are gone which in the s, means ugly primitive rendered cutscenes . this is a step down from jedi knight in every conceivable way.",0
"this game is an amazing transformers experiens, the only real problume i have is with the list of playabul bot's. i know that thare is dlc for this that adds skins for optamis,sideswipe, and bumbulbee, but i fell like thare shoud be more.i whas thinking of an idea for dlc that adds -an new campain - new non reskin bots mybe ultra magnus,sunstreaker,arcee, amp idk a flying guy if possible -new bosses -and new skins for grimlock and wheeljack i dont know spasificly what, but just something new but seriorsly, play this gamer, its grate, dont let my rambling put you off, this is an good game.",1
everything about this game is one word. beautiful,1

"what can i say, i meet the requirements for the game -graphics card radeon rx - check -ram gb- check -cpu fx - check -os windows - check -crash on min recap video- check so.. yeah.. possibly the worst way to figure out what the hell is going on in behind the scenes of the game for this crash. this is my first time plaiyng this series. i meet all the requirements, but it still crashes. if anyone can provide an expert opinion on this matter please feel free to help me out. update fixed the crashing, but no excuse when you meet the exact requirements to play this game on very high settings. there is no way in hell i should be getting a constant to fps. more on the developers end than on mine. if there was refund button for this game from amd, i would press it a thousand times over. at this point in time, i would say this awesome looking game is competely unplayable at this point until the devs can figure out a way to get the fps to a higher degree.",0

"i've completed the story twice. the game is pretty good, but don't buy it on pc. all the benefits to having it for pc are thrown out of the window. first off, you need to have steam and uplay. then, you need a pc made by jesus to run it. barely anybody plays on multiplayer so you will run out of options pretty fast. just get it on console.",0

nice game. must have. its difficult for beginners but i see how the developer tries to make the start easier.,1
scott made the game really extreamly super awsome!!,1
i've switched from recommending this game to not recommending this game based on how far i get in the game.,1
black textures instead of map.. only character visible on any grapics settings.. tiresome,0

"super boring game with no tips or instrctions to tell you what new things they introduce in a level. crappy, lazy developer. i feel ripped off, and i even got the game for free. the original lemmings games were so much better than this. and how do you cahrege for this? this is more like a phone app.",0
not my thing. heavy on exposition. there was a whole 'game' in there that could have at least hinted as to what was going on.,0

"i am die-hard fan of books, but i couldn't stomach this game. while the concept is good, the world feels the same as in books, and there're many great ideas for an rts game, the execution is sadly awful. i really wanted to like this game, but .. no way. outdated graphics, no ai to speak of, bad controls interface, poor combat, no tactics. it's much better to buy crusader kings and play game of thrones mod. overall it would be nice game around , but i'd still rather play dune over this turd.",0
hecka laggey. play if you have a really beffey computer,0

honestly one of the best games i've ever played.,1

"absolute superb rpg adventure game for the year of ! i bought this game on the playstation as it was the 'next-gen' third person game that i was really really looking forward to. and i just blew me away, the entire story line and the gameplay was done expertly and made for such a good expericence. which is the main reason i wanted to purchase this on the pc once i had built one to run this game at the best possible settings and experience it all over again. would definitely recommend this game if you enjoyed other games such as dragon age, world of warcraft and diablo. and even if you haven't played any i have just listed and you're looking for your first then i highly reccomend the witcher wild hunt steamhappy",1
will someone tell me how to sighn in to uber so i can play? pls?,1
"alan wake is most likely the best game i've played thus far that combines psychological horror with a heavily plot-driven storyline that leaves much to the players' interpretations. while it is true that other games have accomplished one or the other on their own, very few have successfully combined both for a lengthy gaming experience - with the only others in my mind being fatal frame and the early renditions of silent hill. if played on a higher difficulty, one truly experiences the definition of psychological horror a feeling of helplessness against the might of alan's dark enemies. the somewhat painful in a largely bad sense of the word sequences in the forests are offset by very great moments of the game, such as the concert and night life in bright falls. while the combat will eventually feel lacklustre, alan wake never fails to deter the suspense and interest that a game of this genre and caliber should generate. on a side note, i felt the change of gameplay and plot focus in american nightmare to be quite refreshing. sign me up for episode .",1
the begining of the game sets an unachievable deadline. after restarts i had played for almost hours and gave up for a refund,0

"okay, this game. it's a really neat concept, but the only downfall is that it is too short. you can literally beat it in about minutes. if they expanded with the stories, or added more it would be great.",0
game was . highly recommend all three of the games though this one sent my mind for a huge trip all three played in order are one of the best series i've ever played.,1
"i've been playing call of duty since cod , and this is not cod. when i played the free weekend i only attempted to play the multiplayer since that was all available and i was blinded by the bright and blurry graphics, horrible gameplay, and overpowered killstreaks. now i wonder why this is called call of duty still, this game is totally against the title.",0
"this game is very slow placed and is never to the point. i think in a attempt to be deep and metaphorical, the story get very lost and muddied up. i only through to chapter , if you dont have a lot of patience i would not recommend this game.",0
this game is a pay to win for both pvp and pve don't waste the time of day,0
"this is truly a masterpiece. altough it took me only hours to finish the game, i felt like i was playing it for days.. so brilliant, imaginative and immersive were the landscapes. the story is set into beautiful, fairytale-like viking world which has totally devoured me. combine these with strong, emotional moments driving you to tears and you'll get one of the most exquisite and shiny jewels upon the field of gaming.",1
"pewdiepie made this game look more fun then it is, it is not bad but eh out of",1
this game would be so sick if my computer would actually run it,0
"pretty awful over-the-shoulder amp cover to cover kind of third person shooter. boring and seemingly inefficient weapons paired with pretty bad sound effects offer you nothing in terms of gameplay experience. plenty of classic flaws like stuff getting between your gun barrel and your crosshair, meaning you should expect shooting plenty of wall corners if you don't step entirely out of the cover. in short pretty damn useless console port. might offer fun if played with friends but i can not recommend getting this for any price. you should probably skip this even if you got it for free. theres' a bazillion 'average' shooters out there and this one is below them.",0
even though i have only played it hours because my mom refunded it i really love this game and would like to buy it back if i ever save up enough money! get this game it is so freaking addicting and extremely fun!,1
fairly decent game if you're into the style which i am but chocked full of bugs. ai sometimes completely ignores assigned duties and you wake up with all oxygen recyclers dying. might be a good game later on but for now it's just frustrating to play.,0
"an interesting game. must admit, not too exciting. but worth playing. it is not really long, and a very short download. and despite being free, it isn't a game. it's actually pretty good. it's like reading a poem. although it can be a tad boring at the start, it's worth playing until the end, as it has a very cute and pretty ending so go play, it's a nice expirience!",1
"this game is amazing! but after the . update, most people can't even launch the game. it's been almost a week and the team has done nothing about other than posting a fix that doesn't work. get it togethcer chucklefish!",0
"this is a modern-day gauntlet legends without the adventure aspect but with a ton more rpg elements. drop-in drop out local online combination multiplayer makes this one a blast to play with your friends, wherever they may be. the player classes all have different towers and powers, so experiment and go wild!",1
"play this boss- game if you have money, if you dont go mug people and buy it god-damnit!",1
"sorry, but no. i waited a long time for this and it was a let down. if it's your first total war game then think again, read some reviews and buy a different title. if you're a long term fan you'll know what i mean.",0
the game didn't even get past the start screen! ughhhhhhh,0
"its fun for a bit but as you get to the harder missions it doesnt indicate what threshold for replacing a part is required. it ends up being a frustrating pattern of trial and error disassembling, then re-assembling the whole car. maybe they'll fix it up some and make it into a fun game. would be nice to actually take apart the engine rather than repeatedly fix the suspension.",0
for best experience play the main storyline co op,1
"gt at level gt enemy spawn level loaders gt dies a hundred times gt down the toilet level level loaders, would wait for seconds respawn again",0
"i don't get why the devs left.. the game is fun and there are still new players popping in. there is a very small playerbase but there are enough to get some games going now and then. if the devs came back and worked on it, i'm sure it would pick up and be a lot better.",1
i am a huge total war fan and i love the warhammer lore but the dlc for any of the total war games is ridiculous. this will be the last total war game i buy until after to years after release and its on sale. creative assembly is hurting their fan base more than anything. overall great game lacks alot of the races found in warhammer but i guess we will be charged heavily to get all the races.,0
i regret buying this game. i get the most bottleneck experience in mortal kombat x.,0
"yay, asset flips for cards - -",0
though it is a hard game but its good..i am loving it,1
"out of no man's sky is a great game to while away the hours. there are a number of things they got wrong with the game but if you like exploring and finding stuff then this is a great game. if not then you're screwed it becomes a boring grind very quickly. i mean it if you're not into exploration this is not the game for you. i'd like to see a lot more customisation, for your own ship, weapons. it has some customisation but you cannot expand and you are stuck with the configuration of the ship. for example you learn how to make landing pads but you cannot relocate them, same for the key components of the ship. customisation doesn't extend to the look of your ship weapon either. once you've learned all the skills, weapon amp ship upgrades, then it just becomes a grind for bigger amp better ships as you head towarsds the centre of the galaxy.",1
first one was better this is sh t last one had depth etc but this nothing..,0
"fun the first time. boreing every time after that. you know whats coming so it stops being scary. spoiler alert! just use the lights , stay off the camera and just watch the doors. at am you should have - left, close one door and just watch the other. its super easy to beat.",0

"great fun game, love the story and music,",1
cool game. hard to find constant games to join for pvp. basic graphics. i want to give a decent grade but its yes or no. if you have friends to play with i would recomend this but its still a game that enjoyment doesnt last long. fun if you have friends to make a pvp match with and want to play a game you can finish within the hour.,0
"it runs maxed on my laptop, im sold",1
"there are more quality vns out there with fewer grammatical errors, typos, and better stories than this but your weebish degeneracy knows no bounds so you'll set out and acquire this to see cgs that you can find elsewhere online.",1
"clitchy, flawed, buggy, cheats work in secured servers - basically just horrible to play.",0
if you liked the original edition then you'll love this. it's probably fair to say if you strung enough mods to the original that you'd get the same experience but this is more long term available.,1
"do not buy this game if you have or ever intend to have a webcam or any kind of livestream program installed on your computer. it will not work. this game will not run on a computer that has either of these two things installed on it. it doesn't matter if they're enabled, and it doesn't matter if they're running. if they exist on your hard drive, the game will not boot up. this is a documented problem with many users and one that ea has flat-out refused to fix. this is because ea are swindlers and thieves. do not purchase this game.",0
"i found this game boring, really really boring. to alleviate my boredom i would decide to go on a good old fashioned grand theft auto style rampage, but every time i did anything outside the story line an npc would call demanding to be social, and if i turned them down my relationship with them would be damaged, i was being punished for not participating in the absolute worst thing that this game has to offer. all i wanted to do was have fun, and the game wouldn't let me without interfering. sure, the game looked good, and if you can bring yourself to care about the story line then i'm sure that there is some value in it. but twice i've tried playing through this game, the second time because my save files randomly got wiped, and twice i've just ended up frustrated and bored, so very very bored.",0
"this game is deceptively cute. i started it thinking 'oh, the ghost looks like an adventure time character, how bad can this be? the 'jump scares' are just cardboard cutouts literally .' i was wrong. this game is unique, in that it can be both cute and scary. the graphics put me in mind of majora's mask for n . it brought back some nostalgia, and made the game even more fun. well, as fun as screaming at your computer whilst running from evil puppets and man-eating pregnant women can be.",1
good graphics. but where the hell is the other missions!! this game took me mins to complete and i spent lots of money on this wtf! feel like ive been robbed!,0
great example of a pure game,1

i like the program but is there a way u could enable it to be controller accessable to all games thanks,1
one of the most addicting games i have ever played.,1
the game looks fun but way too many bugs,0
"i liked that the fact that you can do many things and i have dislikes. first the money is well.. money you can make it like rasins or somethings that you could only get in a prison. seconed, me and my cousin want to play it together thats why i made this comment because we facetime sooo we can figure it out to escape and talk to each other.,",1
"i really enjoyed the campaign, it was amazing. but when you can't even play co-op or multiplayer without getting errors its not worth it. on top of all the bugs that infest the co-op and multiplayer is the fact that you have to create a separate uplay account because for some reason when i purchase games on steam i expect steam to run them, and not have to jump through dozens of hoops to do so. if you want to waste your money on this, be my guest, but even with the cool singleplayer mode its not really worth all the pain it will bring you.",0
everyone clearly played this game for the black rose,0
there's me life and personality in two robots and one voice recording than nearly any game i've ever played. this puts even movies to shame. also puzzles. i guess that's a thing too.,1

"i am always crawling back to this game when i feel like platformers. the multiplayer aspect is great because i like how it enforces team work. personally, i have never played on normal mode, only insane so when i play with friends we have to work together. i enjoy the kawaii art style similar to that of castle crashers i also recommend .",1
"a great medieval fps, not to be confused with that other title with chivalry in the name.",1
the cutscenes make me want to cry,0
"review cower single player. i had strong feeling i play some 'binary domain' but in other setting. enemies spawning from nowhere are not realy funny in 'tactical' shooter. game have few nice features, but repeating some action hundred times become boring.",0
really bad framrates. computer exceeds mininum and reccomended system requirements and even so with all settings down at low it still has the worst frame rate ive played in any games,0
"i'd heard various criticism of bioshock infinite and since i still haven't played the originals i wasn't really sure if this game would be very accessible. i just finished the main campaign and have to say that this game felt revolutionary, sort of how i felt after seeing star wars for the first time. the world is beautiful and very well-developed, and i love that there is a wide enough range of difficulty settings to let you experience the story even if you aren't a seasoned fps player. combat is fun and varied and generally avoids the feeling i get in some other games where you feel like you're just fighting wave after wave after wave. i also really liked the way that it encourages exploration yet keeping the game brisk. i was able to complete the main campaign in less time than it takes to finish a single player civilization game, which made it feel like it really didn't water anything down. i'm excited to go back and give the first bioshock a try and can't wait to see what ken levine and irrational put together next!",1
"this game is awesome, enough said.",1
"indie portal without portals, but with mind-bending puzzles and twisted labyrinths. discovery behind every corner. an atmosphere of transcendency and yet of some complex logic and interconnectedness.",1
"big issue with compatibilty, make sure you have the system requirements for this game before you go buying it. dark souls players who run vista will not be able to run this game which requires windows and dx , which sadly steam only offers the windows required version that doesn't support dx . on another note, dx players cannot play with dx - players. i would love to comment on the game itself but the problem stands against the fact the game splits it's players right down the middle. no hate on the game as a whole just it's overall setup and compatibilty.",0
"whew where to begin with this thing. as always i'm a sucker for things with skill tree properties and open world games, but the game has faults that stopped me from playing half way into the game. i'm referring to the tab button for the map. it stopped working after hours of playing. looked at forums and saw that others had experienced the same problem, but way earlier than me, around september time when the game first came out. i bought it almost a month later not sure what exactly causes the problem. seems to be random or maybe it's when a player does a certain activity event motion that triggers this. a week after i see a post stating that they are finalizing the patch that fixes the map issue, but it'll be another couple weeks i don't know about others, but finalizing means that they are done and are ready to send it out for an update for players. recommend the game, but only until they fix this map issue.",1
"this game is the definition of pay to win. starter guns do little to no damage, while any gun you pay for locks zombies in place when shooting at them. this game is less balanced than destiny.",0
does anyone really like this?,0

"the elder scrolls is probably the best roll-playing game series i have ever played. in my opinion only the witcher series could rival with the elder scrolls. skyrim plot it is absolutely brilliant, history of dovahkiin will totally absorb every fan of rpg games for even on hundreds of hours. i am amazed by the world of skyrim. it's open world with a hundreds of side quests whose number we can enlarge by three dlc and many modifications. graphic and soundtrack stand on a really good level. i would recommend skyrim to anyone who wanna chill with game.",1

"ok, lets do a simple little review. pos its fun. can be scary sometimes nice atmosphere ranks leveling addictive cant stop playing it neg no party matchmaking ranks broken when you auto escape. you lose one point wraith its a little bit op. need tweaking matchmaking is a little bit funky. failed to join game etc. variety, only chars need atleast . no keyboard remap your stuck with wasd. use autohotkey all for all it is good, but in theory they should not of released it as is, they should of waited a few months got the bugs out then released it, then all of them negs would be gone. dont get me wrong its fun and very addictive. its cheap so why not pick it up and give it a go if you dont like it refund is your friend.. bill",1
"amazing, graphics are great, story is rich, characters are alive. thank you so much!!",1
"does not work well with linux. first it was choppy graphics, after an hour of trouble shooting to get that fixed the sound is choppy stuttering. completely unplayable. looked nice, but unplayable on linux",0
not well optimized amd r . p fps,0
its the slow cousin of diablo . and they made deadpool not fun. you decide.,0
an amazing game worth every dime you pay for it. this game will give you so many hours of fun it's unbelievable and when you do feel you're done with it you can just download one of the many mods.,1
this game is very hard and dark but is it so fun,1
best fps shooter i have ever played my favorite out off the,1
"it's fun. yes. but for - hours maybe when you earn money to customize car, later you just repeat it until you get everything. then what? then you can admire views of bugged graphics, feel not existing physics seriously, if you have f.e. hp mx you can make backflip! and ummm thats it. there are no challenge modes where you could compete with other players, no solo career to make the game more interesting. i didn't except too much for euro but the game proved me that's worth no more than .. update out of the game is still bad.",0
worse flight sim ive come across in all my years you have to purchase a plane its certianly not free to play i'm steering clear of this company trhey need to learn from more successful companies like dcs world,0
"pretty addictive, with a lot to bring you back and keep playing. there seems to be an event every weekend or so that gives you extra fleet marks, r amp d mats or rep marks, which is always nice. if you're willing to put in the time, you don't need to spend any real money to succeed in this game. if you're not willing to put in the time, but you're willing to spend money, you can go that route, but you'll still need to put in time to upgrade your ship's equipment. the only negatives i have are the ground combat issues, and the occasionally too overpowered enemy ships.",1
"sadly this feels like a game that would be out of date even on it's release day. while the fundamentals are there, the developers appear to have utterly failed at delivering the full potential of the concept. unfortunately with something as epic and engaging as feudal warfare, you really have to use the right tools to provide an experience worth having. this game is currently sat queued for a refund, which will hopefully come through shortly and erase my mistake.",0
"this is a nice game but fun if you only play with your friends, but the teams were balanced but for some reason an update made it unbalanced again.",1
"muv luv is a glorious hour waste of your life if you're a masochist who likes cute girls, robots, and crying this game is for you",1

"the best space hillbilly simulator on the market. out of , would bootleg space moonshine again.",1
great game to log back into everyday.,1
"disturbingly addictive. my friends were in shock that i got all the acheivements in the matter of around months while also writing a graduate thesis. let's just say my late nights were more often then not losing track of the time while trying out new angles in the game. fantastic replay value, and twists and turns that literally dropped my jaw. love the game, and if you like story and mathematical strategy, you may too.",1
great game. love the puzzles. very addictive. great job valve!,1
"another solid jrpg by the zeboyd developers, and a fitting conclusion to the penny arcade game series. funny dialogue, amazing soundtrack, very solid gameplay. as was the case with episode , stay away from normal difficulty as it is far too easy.",1
"this ia poor mis mash of fps archetypes. poor execution, sloppy controlls and no reall feeling of authenticity.",0
"my friend gifted me this game one day, and the only prior knowledge i had was that there was some turquoise looking dude in the game, all i really knew. i never looked into this game for some reason. i've played hundreds of games across a bunch of platforms, and it's clear to me that this is definitely one of the best games i've ever played. i couldn't name a single flaw that's just me in this game the combat is smooth and extremely fun, the game is absolutely gorgeous, the few main characters are awesome though i guess i'm the only one who didn't hate fidget , voice acting was pretty good i think i saw xander mobus in the credits? and frikin kirbopher? , and i love the art style of the game. . out of too much lava this deserves a out of m",1

"i never imagined that overkill or any video game company could possibly up a game that's as fun and addictive as payday . yet somehow they managed to do the impossible. don't expect to have any fun with explosives, miniguns, sniper rifles or molotovs without forking out your steam wallet for dlc's that end up costing more than the actual game. now they've even decided to introduce microtrasactions when they promised a long time ago they never would. good job overkill for ruining such an awesome game.",0
yes but its too spooky me,1
"although this game is a bit short, it was worth every penny. if you played trine amp , like i did, it takes a while to get used to the controls. but after that, this game is just awesome. the combat and puzzles are not to hard and not to easy. the d perspective brings another good thing to this game. i love it. the graphics are just awesome the game looks awesome. but the gameplay is a bit short. but because there is a possibilty to make mods and play mods i think there will we more user created content to download and play which makes it even more worth to play buy. the story, well that was just a dissappointment. it starts of soooooo well, but the ending just leaves you out in the blank. the developers dont know if they even complete the story because of the bad response low profit and high costs of the game. i suggest, you buy this game and have a good out of hours of fun. the mods. and support frozenbyte to develop some dlc's or a trine , to continue the story.",1
"had to update my review after the considerable amount of hours spent in grim dawn. all i can say is i have found my favourite arpg. from the desolation of iron lore and disappointment from d , crate entertainment's grim dawn rose and stepped into the arpg hack amp slash scene, like the protagonist who steps in the nick of time to save the world. for such a incredibly low price, crate delivered a lot more than what the players paid. the flexibility of classes, the dark ambience, the challenging modes and last but not least the consistent updates from the developers contribute to what i can only say one of the best games ever made. fun fact crate entertainment has employees while diablo was worked on by at least blizzard employees, it's like pied piper vs hooli's hatch or whatever that they worked on.",1
"simulated difficulty by stacking enemies. no tactical options. long tedious setups that result in same ai charge tactics with unlimited movement. character creation is designed for you to miss things along the way. stack for combat or get owned every step of the way. stack for skills and you will have a very rough time of it. go somewhere in the middle and you are creating a useless character. party roles are predetermined, cliche' an boring. sniper, medic, thief amd leader. anything outside that is bound to fail. skill system is not fleshed out. forces you to replay the same story with the same setup. they advertise the playthrough is different everytime..it's not..the loot is different..the story is not. they advertise your choices make a difference and have consequences. here are your choices are you powerful enough to kill whatever it is you off? if you are you get loot..if not you die. choice selection list over. this is a game that should be at best. wait for a sale on this one. it will be there soon. same song as most fan funded, greenlight and indie titles. lots of promises and no delivery.",0
"summer addendum for smallworld . many of the horrible design choices, especially concerning the dismal online matchmaking, have been corrected and the game isn't broken anymore in that way, but it's still terribly glitchy and prone to crash. i doubt the developer's commitment to sparkle motion here probably never will work properly, which is amusing for a boardgame port. original review the board game itself is solid, casual multiplay, but jeeze is this version pretty lamely ported. originally a touch screen mobile game, this steam version looks nice but harbours some pretty dumb ux design choices and bugs that, mercifully, the developers have been patching from day one. it's a little broken, crashes and glitches out every now and then and people that just stop doing their turns or quit the game, aborting the match for everyone involved are still a huge problem as of feb .",1
"easy to use, tutorials are spot on. recommend game for anyone into fighting games who actually wants full control over there player.",1
"rimworld is better, with crazy stories and choices. cannibalism anyone? ai and bad vision make this game a chore to play. pass, not worth .",0
one of the best games you will ever play in your life the story is so rich and you will love every moment of it out of woof,1
"its a nice mix of shadowrun returns and the newer xcom game. since its a mix of both, it lacks much of the story and rpg elements of shadowrun returns, and lacks a bit of the depth of the combat system of xcom. the result is a 'light' version of xcom set in a shadowrun world. its fun, its still going through its release issues, but its still enjoyable. if you have played shadowrun returns and ever wished 'man, i wish there was more combat' or if you have ever played xcom and said, 'i wish this took place in the shadowrun universe' then you will most likely enjoy this game. give it a few weeks or so for them to iron out the issues, the devs seem really dedicated to improving the game.",1

i have found my time with this game enjoyable. worth picking up for a few bucks. just as a heads up it is hard and the controls take a little while to get you to if you have played a lot of meat boy or electronic superjoy,1
boring ugly game about ugly boring people and their poor kid. don't bother playing.,0
"extremely fast-paced, challenging and rewarding top-down retro shooter. there's some kind of vague story but it's the gameplay that matters you get killed in a single shot so really each level is like a puzzle with you working out in which order you should take out the enemies and how, bearing in mind a margin for randomness as weapons change each time you die. very, very fun game. challenging but rewarding.",1
pros best game ever cons whats that?,1
"this game is probably appealing to many, but it reminded me way too much of what high school romance is like even though they are supposed to be in college . this game left me rolling my eyes, recognising all the dramatic subtext that i probably used myself at that age. this game also left me feeling dirty as if emily was insisting i or took advantage of her, when the entire game i remained aloof and as uninterested as i could be! it made me even more mad, because i felt it was she who was being pushy about coming out for the weekend. she was obviously on the rebound. i don't know, maybe teens will get more appreciation from this game. maybe even some adults. this is just one of the most disatisfying waste of time games i've played to date. on the plus side, i got all of the achievements in minutes.",0
amazing. lives up to the hype. out of would bang kiera again.,1
"binding of isaac is a great game, but not a game for everyone. it is very challenging, takes some time to learn, and you either grow to love it, or hate it. the best comparison is dark souls. every game is random generated, so you may play it a hundred times and it is always different. with hundreds of items, upgrades and mutations, you sometimes produce a crazy combo. what bothered me, a lot, is a complete lack of tutorial or even description of items. you have to play this game with a wiki open, it is impossible to deduce what some of the items do on your own. the price is great, so i'd recommend to buy it, if you get through the difficult start you will spend dozens of hours on this",1

"a game that will never leave early access even though it has. it looks awful, the mechanics are janky and it just isnt any fun. go play the forest if you want a great open world survival game. sorry to the devs, i really wanted to like this but when you released it in its current form as 'finished' i had to give a bad review.",0
"this game is complete . the game is so slow it's like watching a slideshow, and it has nothing to do with graphics settings or my computer. it's a cash-grab on uber's part, little difference from the original and still just as broken. do not buy or get a refund as soon as possible.",0
"one of the best games i have ever played. you will have countless hours of fun in many different types of worlds playing different types of characters. i have not played since the fishing update because i had crafted all the best items and there was nothing to do anymore, but i would reccomend very much! if you enjoy minecraft, you would love this even more. there are so many things you can do, but once you've done most of them, it it'snt that enjoyable anymore. once again, best game i've ever played. out of , will's reviews",1

"terraria is that lightning in the bottle game you always wish would get the recognition it deserves, frequently bought for it's price and forgotten to the bottom of steam libraries. this game starts slow, feeling like a minecraft clone in d, slowly though, you uncover more and more to this game. 'oh, there's magic?' yup, 'boss fights that feel like super metroid or castlevania?' uh huh 'hold on, there are firearms including a minigun?' you ain't seen nothing yet. terraria opens itself up slowly, it's a nesting doll of excitement, just when you think the game has gotten ridiculous enough it just keeps adding more. from star cannons, to chainsaws, to spiderman web throwing. that is what makes this game feel so big while being so small. if you are a gamer that likes to mod to add more content, flavor, or mechanics. this is the game for you.",1
"bland, uninteresting, without soul. made by people with no interest in the genre whatsoever.",0
"did you have fun with legos? were you the kind of kid who liked putting together buildings for your toys? then terraria could be for you! this is a d platformer game of gathering and surviving, where you mine ores and minerals to forge tools, weapons, and buildings in a world teeming with treasures and life most of which is hostile .",1
"this game had tons of potential, and as someone else top positive post says, you can play this for a few dozen hours. so if it's on sale, that would be worth purchasing for say, a couple of dollars. but it is unfinished and doesn't look like will ever get finished.",0
"this game isn't very scary, the shooting doesn't feel good, the voice-acting is bad, and the stealth mechanic is terrible. the atmoshpere is well done with cool mind-break effects when the protagonist gets nervous or scared. the overall plot is good, but i can't recommend this game to anyone who isn't a lovecraft or horror fanatic. . out of",0

purchased the definitive edition because i enjoyed the originals years back. i am very dissapointed with the finished result and completely regret the purchase. i wish i had just purchased the original versions again instead. way better in every way. everything about the re-release of this game is bad. i feel jipped of my money and so will anyone else that played the originals. they should be ashamed. having said that. i am going to play the heck out of it to get my moneys worth.,0
this is a game? i thought it was just a long string of microtransactions did ea make this or something?,0
"i have been playing this game for over a year now on the ios version but never wanted to go the extra on the pc version. my friends all told me it was nearly the exact same only with a few extra items and bosses and the controls were harder to use. i thought about this and after killing duke fishron and getting nearly all of the end game items, i decided to try it out. i have never thought more wrong. this game is amazing, the gameplay is way better than ios and the controls are harder to get the hang of but way better in a gamer's perspective. i like the fact that there is now lunatic cultist and the moon lord and now i have nearly all of the end game weapons already. add me if you want help on boss fights or rare equipment or just plain old pvp",1

"i think this must be what people mean when they say, 'polishing a turd.' there are lots of layers of polish on this game - an original soundtrack, a flashy trailer, d environments - but that masks the fact that rocketbirds is flawed at its core. the movement controls feel awful, the level design is predictable and the gameplay is extremely limited. i couldn't stand more than an hour. not worth the price tag. but hey, i got it for free.",0

"pretty generic. there is no sound effect for turrets firing and the music ing blows hard. and it's one of these types of games if you do not play exactly as the developer intended, you lose. you have to deploy the turrets and stations that the developers want you to set down in the order that they want. there is zero freedom to have fun and play how you want. you have to play how they want you to play and follow a predetermined pattern to win a level because if you don't deploy exactly the right turrets in exactly the right amount of time, you lose. what a lousy tower defense game.",0

"i love survival horror games, resident evil, silent hill, fatal frame, rule of rose, you name it, i'm no newbie to the genre. i just couldn't get into this game though. i think part of is that you can't really run away from enemies later on, the rest is i guess i just wasn't feeling it at all. i can't really recommend this game because of it, its just real boring.",0

it's half a game - released in drips and drops along with new cash shop content to entice you to spend money while you wait for a full game. the content as is a maybe or days worth of fun - then you hit the level cap and find out all there is left ot do is grind one dungeon over and over and over or grind for pointless pets the allure of the mount and pet system fades after the first few dozen - pokemon this aint . or else you can participate in the worst mmo pvp ever concieved - imbalance gank fest of the highest order. the day the pvp patch came out which i and several in my guild were hoping for as a reason to stay was the death of that guild and the game for me. such a pity - this game had huge potential - but seriously these korean mmos need to stop the staggered release bullsh t and just release a whole game. aa - bdo - and now roi. this is my last korean mmo burn. im never spending money on anything from sk again.,0
"a mix of ftl and homeworld, this game grabs much from both parent games, but can't really make the most out of it. - the combat is repetitive and the ai is pretty dumb. - the graphic style is good, but seems to be blurry and unsharp. - the maps are very small and the missions on them are repetitive also. fly there, cap that, destroy these, etc. - ships can shoot in any direction, fly in any direction etc. there is no maneuver, or allining the weapons toward the enemy, in other words, no tactic. - the 'rpg' element is pretty flat aswell. your ships progress after a few battles and can pick one of three perks then. conclusion this gmae literally lacks the depth it needs.",0

really fun game and got some crazy fun multiplayer servers out there,1
best game ever so worth the dollars i bought the first portal and its debaitible if it was worth it due to the very short campain and limited things to do but this game is waaaayyyy better it it what the first should have been. that being sad i would say to buy the first one so that you can get the story for the second so basically what im saying is the bundle is so worth it it was a lot of fun the charecters made me laugh the plot twists were good this game definatly gets my stamp of approval support these developers i am excited to see what we get from the future.,1

"minutes is all it took for me to deduce that this game would be best suited for a young child. movement is slow, enemies pose no threat and merely provide something for you to stop and shoot to progress, and the background and foreground feature isn't even original. wario land on virtual boy did it back in . the devs knew how to make a game look good and make it function well, but they didn't know how to make it engaging. after just minutes of playing, my head was hanging to the side and my mouth was hung open as my brain cells realized they were no longer needed and went into standby mode. i know minutes isn't normally long enough to judge a product, but i don't need to eat an entire crap sandwich to know that i don't like the taste.",0
"'the long-haired beautiful anime, with her pistol blades and mind-blowing leaps, whirls and swirls from one fantastic level to the next.' what the is a beautiful anime? i think this game was made in russia and was an early xbox ps release so it sorta goes hand in hand that its probably not going to be very good because those facts. i played some of it, was extremely repatitive in the first minutes or so and go bored to death in a hurry. i enjoy some hack and slash games but most are total garbage. this just seems to be a crappy game. the graphics design in the prerendered scenes and the game are also totally diffrent to the point that when i got into the game i thought something glitched. this just seems to me a worse version of a game we all have played. whether thats god of war or whatever isn't important, the important fact is that this game is meh.",0
i was disappointed to find out all the different game modes arent available in this version. i didnt realize the version on the xbox was different. i would have rather put the to gw had i known ahead of time this is just one game mode. oh well. still an awesome game and now i have more incentive to buy the latest release.,1

"pros you get to destroy nearly everything in a very large city. destroying things feels good. cons very buggy, as you can no-clip through the ground, walls, cars, and many others. some of the vehicles in the game are not well done, the trucks will bounce up and down, the drone will start randomally spinning, then decend into the ground. the voice acting is really bad. in some of the missions, you are required to take out other cars. the damage ratio in between you and other cars, is often tilted to where you get far more damage for doing something small. i play minecraft, and minecraft is in a constant state of 'buggy'. although, minecraft . of the time is playable all the same. this game's bugs are many, and most are game mission breaking. this is one of the few cases that i say the bugs outweigh the worth.",0
possibly the only game in history that could be described as 'wacky' while still being fun.,1
be carful. this game is so great you may play it for days straight and be in danger of death due to dehydration,0
"this game only has three medium sized playable maps. they claim the maps are different every time, but i never really noticed anything different. in my opinion, its not fair to call this a finished game. if you'r game isnt a moba, then it should have more than maps on 'release'.",0

"too many bugs for a dad with very narrow windows to game. played tutorial and made many attempts to play the first mission however enemies with x-ray vision or enemies that essentially ceased to exist after interacting with the protagonist made it thoroughly unenjoyable. if you have the time to fiddle with faqs and possible patches or mods, i get the feeling that it's got a lot going for it mid-to-late game. but i do not. so if you are in a similar gaming situation pass.",0
this game quits randomly all the ing time it's a good game but this is some t don't buy unless you like spending hours playing the same ing game over and over cause you can never ing finish it!!,0
"this wonderful adventure game has a unique mood ! clearly inspired from hp lovecraft, edgar poe and maybe more.. i am not done with it but i've spent a few hours enjoying its game mechanics 'choose your own adventure'-like , its stories, the thrill of exploration in the unknown and dangerous sea, not to speak of the musical themes that add a lot to the mood. if you're not afraid of reading texts in formal english language which is not my native one ! and if you love playing games for much more than dumb mass killing, this one is made for you !",1
"it's too short and quite easy tbh. a very easily attained weapon is nearly unstoppable after a couple upgrades. most of the mechanics of the game aren't necessary because you can just gun anything down. the intro is a little long for such a short game with only three islands to visit. storyline is predictable. coop is mission based only. no story mode coop. that all being said, i probably beat it in a few hours. i had fun, but was a little disappointed at how short and somewhat linear it was. if sales are generous, it could be worth it to you. i preordered it because i craved a zombie game around halloween.",0
"whilst this looks quite promising, i just cannot get-on with the combat at all. when you hit shoot something, it might barely move or it might pinball around the level and explode spectacularly - seems random what actually happens. upgrades seem to offer tiny benefits and are quite tiresome to sort through and the game doesn't pause whilst you do that either!! games looks nice but it's so repetitive that you quickly get lost in the world there are arrows to give hints so the developer clearly realised this but it still means the place is very samey it's the combat tho - it gives the feeling of randomness and damage-sponge enemies and - i can't be bothered with it.",0
the game's quite dissapointing honestly. turns out walking around an area and solving people's problems dosen't really feel that open world. the solutions don't really allow for anything too creative.,0
"decent game, but needs some balancing. a lot of weapon combinations will always overpower everything alse, and this gets incredibly frustrating, incredibly fast.",0
not my cup of tea,0
"i honestly have no clue what this game is about, spent many hours playing this co-op, and really still have no idea what the boss fight was about. pretty disappointed. gameplay was alright. graphics are alright. story sucks. everything else sucks.",0
"come up with this game coincidentally and oh boy such fun game. love old school shooting games, i still play doom out of sometimes and this game is probably as good as the doom francis also the duke francis . though the variety of the maps may not be as rich as doom, there's still a lot to discover includes the secret path, extra rewards and the bible question probably makes it one of a kind. and i love the idea of putting animals into sleep rather than take care of them- no gore no blood no gun totally family friendly. also the difficulty is balanced. i'm used to fps games so i choose normal level which is, the nd hardest for the game. and for the first levels i had some challenges but overall not painfully try to beat each level. i think i'm half way of the game and kind of sure i'll enjoy the other half. graphic is fine, different weapon to choose and different animals, mini boss. out of .",1
didnt expect this game to be so good. one of the best single player fps experiences ive had in a long time.if you like classic doom then you will love this.,1

"not only is this game beautiful, it plays beautifully as well. one of the best all-around indie games ever made, this game should be a treat for anyone who likes story, art, or gameplay. noticeably the soundtrack is some of the best game music i've heard in a long time.",1

gameplay is horrible tf knife is nice would download again for another free item out of,0
good job great game but the repair is so expensive,1
"ten dollars? eh, i've seen less substantial things sell for a lot more. still, i got it for five--- i suggest you do the same. pricing aside, this game is excellent. rudamentary on the surface, but extraordinarilly atmospheric. the musical score, while also simple, draws you into this little fantasy you'll feel like you're in a different world while your brain tightens as you pass through every corridor, through every rolling block. the concept of the game is intriguing as you are literally chasing the setting sun, getting powerups to stay in the light that keeps your ship powered, breathing a legitimate sense of adventure into the experience. it's a great challenge game to play a few rounds with your friends and try to break each other's records. if you're into fast-moving arcadish games, throw this one on your wishlist and wait for a sale.",1
"ugh, what a mess. from the completely unintuitive controls to the inexplicable sound bugs and stuttering, you will find yourself dying death after unwarranted death, while you character does the exact opposite of your intention. i did complete the game, so be aware that a person who can get used to the strange and clunky control scheme could probably breeze through this game in - hours it took me just over . the graphics however are nice, and do a good job of drawing you into the game until you are ripped back out again by some technical faults of the game.",0
made my screen resolution change to p ok thanks no,0
"this game is awesome, it has alot of potential.",1
i thought this was stupid but it is a awesome game,1
a great and atmospheric shooter that lives up to the shock series.,1
"years ago when this game first came out, it was a fairly good shooter that stressed in game co-operation between players. now, after years of updates and modifications, the game sadly lacks the orginal feel of the game. game physics have plunged into the realm of the unbelievable, and server lag has become more than the occassional nuisance. sometimes pure luck is more important that player skill or team work. the developers chose to tweak the game difficulty by creating specials that can defy the very laws of gravity, etc, rather than fix known in game glitches that made the tanks easy to kill. also, it has been ? ? years since a new map was released for the game. add on maps are local host so you can imagine the issues with latency. unless you can get this game dirt cheap, or your a collector of the genre, seriously.. don't bother.",0
we agree with most of the views that the game has potential and for an action rpg the game plays actually well. unfortunately the game is littered with bugs and has a few showstoppers that makes the game unplayable. we aren't bothered about the price of the game - its actually good value but at present feels like an early access game with the bugs left intact. we recommend you stay away from this one. out of .,0
one of the best made games i've ever played. awesome!,1
"painfull slow menus, even slower when using cross-fire setup, awfull performance, no usuability whatsover on the menus where is the retry option for on-line play?, change deck between matches no head giants one of the best modes in the game , slow grinding to get new cards, and incomplete options for deck building, best cards on freemium model wich is a big issue since the game is paid. don't buy until fixed if its going to be fixed at all",0
yay of let's buy it -instal over night -almost done when i wake up -go to school -launch the game -'steam client must be runing to play this game' -restart steam -try again -fail -restart computer -try again -fail -restar anything i see -try again -fail sad but true wont start at all,0
broken game . multiplayer has persistent lag they should refund this. its like playing cs with ping ..,0

this game is great fun and very competative. it's so simple and yet so hard. just try it! it's free!,1
"i have seen the word great used in reviews here a lot. and it is fitting. i would say overall great. i have not been a gamer for too long, have a nice library of games going thanks to steam sales. and this game has the best fanbase i have seen. got some high level players that help me out and i never even seeked out any assistance. there is one thing i have learned in life .. never turn down help. become a tenno it's fun. be warned though it can be highly addictive. i'm hooked hard.",1

yet another shooter tower defense hybrid,0
"a very good mod with fascinating gameplay. best rts fps oldschool style game i've encountered so far. different research trees, fascinating tactical opportunities and rich gameplaymechcanics make this mod a stand for itself.",1
"this game is fun at the start, espically when playing with friends, when your trying to survive constant gun fire and your gun is as damaging as a toy gun! however the more you play this game, the more it becomes about grinding and your eventually you'll find yourself mowing down enemies without any difficulty slowly becoming more about the grind then actually enjoying the game. the darkzone is always fun when starting as a new player, as your constantly battle your way through rogues and enemies and sigh in relief that your stuff is fine! however, yet again, at higher levels, the darkzone will be more about grinding then anything else. when i got to level , my intrest declined in the game, considering that the incursions aren't much fun either. the characters are also very weak as wet paper and often feel they excist only to be memo for your next task. if you are buying this game, i recommend, that you play with friends and reset your save once in a while, as the constant repition of grinding and selling will bore you to death.",0
"puts you staight into the cluster, no tutorial, no explanations.",0
bought this on ps and pc as well. 'nuff said.,1
"it is a decent multiplayer fps in its core with the ghost in the shell flair, but cheating is a real issue with the game, so not recommended at all.",0
"finished it on playstation , rebought it on steam when it was on sale for , would even reccomend buying it at current price of . usd, its worth every cent. not only is this game scary, its intense, and at times can be stressful, so if you scare easy, you may want to stay away, and maybe watch people play on youtube. parts of the game may bring back a nostalgic feeling from fans of the old movies.",1
"if you like games, this is a game.",1
a really fun game. you will need good teamwork so i prefer you to play with friend but the story is very short.. it took me and my friends minutes to complete it so its not really worth the money cuse of the short gameplay.,1
one of the best games i have ever played in my life.,1
i cant even play it! i want a spah knife.,0
"it's dark souls but darker and with different enemies amazing it's very much the same as the older version slow and boring combat, but a lot of variety when it comes to your character , however it's significantly less buggy and just a tiny bit more polished. all of the dlc also comes with this version, so if you're going to buy this game, i would certain recommend considering this version.",0
this game will give you cancer. beware.,0
"a hipster's wet dream, but not a very fun game from what i've experienced!",0
"played this with my brother and it was such a blast. we did get stuck in trial for hour but damn! i love the feeling when we surpassed it. that being said. this is a twin stick coop game that needs good communication and patience. it's crucial to have good planning and strategy as well as alertness and quick thinking. if you are a fan of local coop then i highly recommend getting this game. it has an adequate amount of puzzle, action, and challenging enemies to keep you busy. and prepare to shout a lot.",1
"looks great, sounds great, feels nice, too short. good game? yeah. recommend it? i'm sorry, i can't. maybe if they release the second half, or if you can get it for cheap.",0
good why? force why? unleashed jk lol its bad,0
"really good story, definitely worth your time",1
best military sim game on steam store. you should buy it if you love realistic sim games.,1
"it's presented well, and there's certainly enough horror on offer to keep players entertained, yet somehow outlast fails to inflict the sort of mind-numbing terror that are the hallmarks of the f.e.a.r. and amnesia series. there are times when the game's brilliant - the mandatory chase scenes for example - but the rest of it feels like the horror presented is too overt, as if the developers were trying too hard. this isn't helped by a story that's difficult to become invested in and a main character who has less personality as the monsters you face. outlast is probably the best horror game of , and definitely worth a play if these sort of games are what you enjoy - but at the end of the day it just feels like it's lacking something.",1
i will like it more if in the nest update they make all thing ues in game money and make all thing buyabill,1
"started off real nice, everything you wanted in a mad max game, however its just a giant go collect garbage, not much more to it. story is pretty average, hours tops for the main story, the rest is collecting scrap to buy all your upgrades to continue the story real shame, can really see the devs were rushed, alot of content in the game hints that they were going to go much deeper eg the tools selection for max . one of the biggest problems is all the non-main story boss's all look the same, and fight the same but have different weaknesses, woo. would it be that hard to atleast skin them differently and give them a different weapon, seriously wtf. no big war rigs, big thumbs down for that stupid convoys made vehicle is just a pickup with a large gas tank, they even made the fury road truck prop in the game but as a wreck its in the northen tunnels near gas town.",0
"a fun little management game that's unfortunately too padded out and loses steam the more you play. the game likes to surprise you with big events that you need to address --only they require you to be well-prepared before hand without any warning. it's easy to miss out on entire questline just because you didn't have enough detectives, even though the game has never given you any reason to hire more before. and once you miss these opportunities they are gone, unless you want to replay the entire last week. the game is too long and doesn't have any variety so you don't get much from replaying the game. once you reach a certain point halfway through the game you become so powerful it removes all challenge it once had. there's no point in trying to achieve anything more because nothing you do really matters. the game and the atmosphere started out pretty amazing, but as i was nearing the ending i just wanted it to end, but the ending didn't offer any payoff. it was just a 'that's it?'. whatever they tried to pull off there it didn't come across at all.",0
wait a few seasons to see they deliver what was promised. not recommended in its current state.,0
"i was very excited to get this game, but alas it fails to deliver. don't get me wrong, it is challenging enough to potentially be fun, but it doesn't really allow for long term play. it becomes very boring after a lil' bit, unless you really enjoy solving puzzles, continuously.",0
"insurgency is, in my opinion, a great and realistic fps game. i was introduced to this game by my brother and i got hooked on its gameplay, various objectives and the need for teamwork than other fps which mostly are just spam killing, shooting and aiming. highly recommended and welcome to the company!",1
if you have not recon for mins you will get abandon and low prios even after you recon..i dont recommend this game,0
"this is a great game but it simply wont run now. the game launcher had a big fix prompt that did nothing but waste my time. i uninstalled it and now when i run it through steam it says it can't find the installation. when i open up the files and run the application a different error message comes up. hi rez might think this is okay for a free game but i put money into this crap and now can't access it at all. this is a terrible company who gives zero craps about the fans of their game, and i'm guessing their attitude towards paying customers will bite them in the when no one plays their next game.",0
"it's a game. thats the only real positive thing i can say about it. as far as a simulator goes it is very poorly designed and written out. the right and wrong choices are painfully obvious so theres no real trial and error to play. besides that the choices that would actually help you get out of depression are all blocked, as if everyone with depression has zero mental willpower to try and help themselves. overall my experience with this game has been very depressing indeed, the biggest letdown was the fact there was no suicidal option on the panels, as well as the fact the piano music was driving me insane to the point i had to turn off my speakers and risk not hearing the inevitable gunshot. i would not recommend this game as one to play seriously, but more as to show friends how bad it is.",0
"horribly optimized. it barely runs on a machine built for modern gaming. if you're ok with fps and frequent crashing go ahead and buy it, otherwise it's just unplayable. if you do get it to work there's basically very little to do. there's an incredibly bland and hackenyed campaign and a scant handful of carbon-copy missions. the space combat is simplistic compared to other similar games, as is trading. the galaxy seems lifeless. there are tons of factions but you never get to know them and they never really signify. there are far better games in this genre, some of which are even free to play. it appears that the devs sunk all of their time into building a new engine for whatever reason and not nearly enough on making a game.",0
dumb game. just came for,0
my biggest fear in my childhood was this one butler from some tomb raider game that i couldn't remember. i had only saw a glimpse from it because my uncle used to play it when i was a kid. i never wanted to know what tomb raider it was from. i used to have nightmares where i woke up and saw him next to me with that scary tray with few cups on it. today at my st birthday my friend bought me this game and i quit the game instantly when i saw the butler. out of this game.,0
"unfortunately not worth the usd pricetag. it's a great game, the art is beautiful, the atmosphere is creepy, and the story is a wild ride, however after only getting max hours gameplay, i feel as if the actual price paid doesn't measure up.",0
"looks exactly like the original, has no graphics options, does not support eyefinity, and has all of the bugs of the old one. wtf",0
would like to play emily is away if it out i wait emily be online agin!,1
"the physics make no fahking sense, to many qtes and i dont like how invincible lara is, she falls ft onto a rebar yanks it out and runs without passing out, steps in a bear trap and clearly broke her ankle but walks it off in mins, the fact that for how small she is she can take on full grown wolves, she falls from abormally large heights and shrugs it off. basically what im saying here is that its got way to much video game logic and not enough real logic to make it enjoyable in my book, i honestly dont get how it got a goty it really didn't deserve one at all",0
thank you for this game,1
a buggy grindfest made by developers with no idea what they're doing or how to balance anything. out of would grind for hours again.,1
you will really need some tissue for this. its simple but rich in story.,1
boring and full of cheap jump scares lacks originality in atmosphere,0

i really love the music and levels in this game!,1

"this game is amazing. awesome artwork, great soundtrack, incredible voice actors, fun gameplay, and it magages to make you feel, a rare acheivment. will certainly be replaying.",1
omg this game will delight and destroy you and your confidence. incredibly simple yet deceiving and devious. easy thumbs up for the price and replay value. great title.,1
supposed to be an upgrade for .. many saw it as a down grade.. waste of money. but i had to get it to complete my valve collection.. and non the less.. it is counter strike..,0
"eh. i don't really have an eye for physics games, so this didn't really interest me from the start. i got a coupon for off so i bought it anyway. there are much better physics games than this, and the environments are a little interesting, but the sound effects are really bad. i know it's based on a mobile game, but there's no reason to port it to pc and market it for dollars in my opinion. this does work as a mobile game imo, but not as a pc game.",0
"this game is insane. just look at my hours! can't really fully explain this game in words, so here's a video.",1
potato melts steel beams out of would play again,1
"a very enjoyable although quite short platformer with great art and decent storytelling. narrator's voice acting is a bit off as he is clearly not a native english speaker while everyone else is but otherwise good voice acting. main concern is with level design as the game is about smooth, fast movement thoughout the level combining jumping, running and grappling but every now and then you come to a dead halt for about minutes trying to work out where you have to go next. next to no load times which is a big plus given how often you will fall. i picked this up heavily discounted paying under but i don't feel it's worth the full asking price.",1
apparently this is important originally posted by storepage,0
"this game is so much fun, you get to explore and build and there is so much you can do in the game. if you need a fun game to just play and chill i would recommend terraria, singel- or multiplyer its fun.",1
". hours and i've beaten the game twice. that's way too short for a game. on top of that, the combat system suffers from some major balance issues that make it really easy. sure it's got some really great music and art in it, but the gameplay isn't fantastic and it's far too short.",0
the gameplay is fun and god the grafititi artwork everywhere is amazing!,1
the fun part is the text to speech,1
"awesome game. you are playing as a single soldier american who is often trying to flank or snipe down the enemies using his favourite sniper rifle but in many cases uses different gunpower to eliminate the objects. this is just another of those good games you will progress hardly through enemy lines. one thing that annoys me a lot are the hints that pop up all the time throughout first mission. so far i got to second great mission. one mission consists of parts, so if you use all your medkits, bombs or ammo for machine gun, be sure next level you have spent them and you need to look for another resources from that soldiers, but at the beginning of each session you get some ammo.",1
"do you like designing and building ships to fight in space combat? do you want a game that is free to play, where the dlc is not pay to win? this game is for you. pros the game combines tactical and design challenges well. the ai is challenging without being overwhelming. levels are bite size avg mins?, depending on difficulty and ships . controls are quick and easy. there is multiplayer but i didn't play it . did i mention that the game is free? cons ai can be predictable at times, ship orders movement command are simplistic, which can result in frustration at times ex a fight sits there while another unit just out of its range kills it, when it could have closed and killed the attacker . overall, out of . good entertainment, and the price is right.",1
"some of the weapons could be better, even with the upgrades, but if you enjoyed serious sam or painkiller, this game needs to be in your library yesterday.",1

"had a lot of fun with this game. was entertaining and humorous at the same time. . price tag is fair as well being it comes with trading cards, achievements, and just a nice jab at dlc games.. gets my thumbs up for sure.",1
this is a multiple ending game. also do not throw this game away just because it is a -bit style. so buy this awesome game.,1
"i love the humour of this game. i skipped some of the minigames, because they were boring, others where quit okay. i bought this game on sale, and let's be honest, it's worth more than . cent. there is only one negative thing. i'm talking about the achievements. i got none. i read in the forums about it, and it looks like it's never going to be fixed, so no achievements for me. but if you don't care much about the achievements and would like to play a great point and click game, go on and buy this game.",1
"best fps of the s thus far, hands down. great teamplay, objective oriented, high intensity fps glory.",1
"this game is poorly made. you can't trust anyone! people will kill just as soon as they see you. you'll end up running from everything, and as soon as you die, you loose everything you've gathered so far and start at a random location on the map. there is no basebuilding. they do not update the game. i seriously doubt they will ever fix any of the problems with this game. knowing what i know now, even if this game were free it still wouldn't be worth it. instead, check out day z by bohemia interactive. those guys want to make a good game!",0
"if you die in this game, you either rushed ahead of your teammates, you communicated poorly, or your team was just really bad trolling. this game is heavily reliant on teamwork and is great for playing with friends. tons of replayability, customization and variable levels of difficulty achieved with combinations of mutations game modes difficulty settings. highly reccomended for anyone that likes clicking on zombies and watching them blow up. over and over again.",1
run-of-the-mill class level character system undermines an otherwise decent iso-view rpg. a for effort. c for innovation.,1
this game is probably great on a console with a controller. on a pc while it looks far better than any console is difficult with those quick time events. the precisely timed key combo's are not keyboard-friendly. i pretty much gave up after less than game completion in frustration i do not recommend this game for pc unless you want to just admire the scenery. and have the patience to do qte's repeatedly before you get the timing right without losing track of keys in the heat of battle,0
it doesn't actually work on hp pavillion notebook pc's. it would have been nice to know this before actually buying the game because i cannot get a refund. waste of money. but im guessing its a great game for everyone who can play the game.,0

swedish people have too much time to make annoying block based games. or are they finnish? i don't know one of those european places.,0
"out of , and i'm only giving it the because of the well done narrative. this game, from what i could tell, is a disjointed mashup of levels that the creator released in either an attempt for money, or in an attempt to send a message about the state of steam quality control. i would not recommend this to anyone looking for something similar to the stanley parable, because it's not even close in terms of quality, playability, or even length. i was very disappointed by this title, mostly because i loved the stanley parable and had high expectations for this game.",0
it's a great and addictive game. it's much better than it seems after looking at screenshots or reading description. it's higly playable and fun.,1
what diablo should have been.,1
do not buy the game.. its a ripoff.. it offers hour gameplay and you are done.. the game offers nothing new. and the graphics are nothing good. plus its a extreamly overpriced pvp game.. and has no story or campaign.. or anything really? it offers v and nothing else and u should win all the time. other then that a game that shouldn't be priced higher then euros,0
best game yet !! want to buy the peacekeeper,1
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played throughout my gaming experience. i love everything about it, the skills, graphics, combat functions, interacting engine. i love how you need to find ingredients to create potions, armours, weapons and bombs. after playing this game, this game makes me want to play skyrim from the start. this has got to be the best game that has been released this year.",1
there is no officiall support which really sucks i wanted this game so bad and was so happy when it got on sale. i installed it and then ive got dissapointed so badly.. i had to refund it which im really sad about,0

"i don't know if the people who wrote these reviews are real or fake, because this game sucked major heiny. - - my game time says it all. - not worth ., save your money.",0
"even though the 'release hype' is now over and this game has been hanging around for a while, i would still reccomend it. this game gets the balance of micro-management and general care of your city just right, with fun and captivating gameplay. a fantastic modding community comes with this game aswell, with literally thousands of items to add to your client to improve gameplay or simply make your city unique. as well as that the game is still being patched on a regular basis with the recent addition of european buildings, new maps, and tunnels for roads and walkways. the developers have also recently said that they will continue support for the game as long as they can. this game is certainly going to be around for a while and with such universal gameplay features and even more options added thanks to the mod community this game is certainly a great purchase with good value for money.",1
its really good game if your into the whole gather an army and trying to become king,1
i can run all the games from the mass effect series fine. i can run fallout and skyrim fine. for some odd reason i cannot run this game.. not to mention the bugs.,0
this game has more bugs than the seconds i spent to beat it,0
"i used to love this game but i got tired of dealing with all the griefers and kickers. instead of working as a team you have to deal with all your teammates ganging up on you. you'll get kicked for missing a death charge or not booming all survivors, and if you're new you'll have to deal with some pervert going on your profile and saying hey this guy has less then a hours kick the noob . and even if you're just gonna play the campaing, someone will join and shoot you and your friend and then his friend will join and he'll get his friend to help kick you. if you want to get this game then go for it, but if you do you're gonna have to deal with people like that",0
"great strategy game, just too short",1
'been in development continuously for almost years.'..really? my co-pilot looks like the dude from minecraft! the ui looks like it was made for the amega from back in the 's. this may be a great simulator under the hood but the user interface is a real piece of history. my hometown airport has a lake and the black forest were the runways are supposed to be. not recommended unless you just want to train on ifr because the graphics are meh.,0
its a good game but i dont recommend if u have a bad comp to play it c waste of my money c,0
"meh, pvp sucks currently, ill play the story then move on. pvp doesnt match you with people of equal skill level, prepared to be steamrolled.",0

"very good, and fun game, but after a time is boring",1
"choose out of different classes fighting various types of zombies and at the end of the game fight a boss. it's not your typical zombie type game each zombie has a unique ablitiy and doesn't rely on melee alone. there are tons of maps to play on and custom maps making the game almsot endless fun. for this game is fun enough but for you will get all the dlc getting, most of the characters and majority of the weapons which are boss. the game is a game that goes on sale often and you can always buy it then with all it's dlc. there are many difficulties so u can adjust and see how good you are as well as an objective game mode good survival and awesome co-op out of",1

"i don't especially like if you die, you have to start all over. other than that, great game!",1
'epic battles within seconds!' unskippable intro loading times rrrright.,0
"if you like world war , probably best game for you. graphics out of game engine out of soundtracks out of but however ardennes assault and other campaing are not in the basic game basic game only includes soviet campaign so you need to buy dlc's to play them its kinda sucks but my advice is wait for a discount then buy the bundle worth out of",1
overall its a good game but the devlopers had to intergrate uplay which took me an hour to make an account i fixed this by randomly changeing the date overall the uplay stuff is cancer but the game its self overall is quite good,0
"i was so pro at this,i loved this,but the servers are dead atleast for asia so dont waste your money on this.",1
not very good. it has a cool vibe but pretty poor execution on what could have been a cult classic.,0
"a great game, hour after hour, filled with fun!",1
"this game is fantastic and is basically the perfect mad max experience. the story is great, the gameplay is fun, there's tons of things to do on a massive map, there's lots of customization you can customize your car and you can even customize max! , the combat is good, there's little to no bugs, and not to mention the optimization is probably the best i've ever seen in a pc game, as it runs at a good fps on ultra settings. the game can be really challenging too, so don't expect surviving in the wasteland to be easy. it also doesn't tie in with any of the movies, so it's sort of just its own thing. only downside i really felt this game had was that it was pretty repetitive, but then again what aaa game released in the past years isn't? i highly recommend this game, it's a lot of fun and it's worth playing and will keep you entertained for hours.",1
"i walked into this game hoping for some clerks voice acting. following jeff anderson and jason mewes, i was reallly hoping for more. i've come to find grudgy style humor -extensive conversation you don't make something funnier by pounding words suprises around each corner slapbox comedy i've clocked less than an hour in so far, clearly showing that i am fully knowledable. in actuallity this is a point and click adventure, with personality. if you are into that sort of thing, you may enjoy this. yep.",1
"one of the best games in the gta franchise. beautiful and tons of fun. there's a lot to do in the pc version, both online and off. great game. definitely recommended.",1
"this game has a story with multiple endings. each time you play you might end up changing things that affect your next game. also the characters you create on each time you play end up as npcs and will attack you, so every time you play try making them as different as possible for easy recognition. play it, it s delicious time somewhere.",1

super cool valve is awsome!!,1
"this definitely a game you'd consider, with all the unreal things you can do, easy to run, doesn't require a good pc aswell as having a blast easily, however one thing i disagree with this, is it burns hours amp hours.. without noticing. p overall a great game to play while realistic features along with the awesome dlcs .",1

prison life builder stimulator out of,1
"this game has alot of potential. it's really fun alone for cool combos or duel replays or against people to show your stuff out although in vs. matches you seem to need to make short combos to win. i wish i could change some of the keys though, i keep pressing 'c' instead of 'd' to move the camera and it resets all of the things i've done!",1
"this game truly deserves the title of 'most improved'. i've played since launch and since it has become playable and grown into a fully triple a game rivalling titles like diablo or torchlight. it has a really fair f p model, and though the grind can be overwhelming most of the time the game is engaging enough to cover the fact that you are just repeating content. nothing in the game is gated behind paywalls or microtransactions. all heroes and items can be obtained with in-game currency, it just take longer. recomended.",1

"a very meh vr experience. there are far better free games to be played. doesn't seem very optimized, i was getting some stutter. the height changer thing is kind of cool, but other than that very meh.",0
"i love doom , but bfg edition is the worst thing, that happend with this game. flashlight is built in, they pierced it through the shoulder of the protagonist. this greatly breaks gameplay. in some levels it was dark, and there was some small light source. so, now you can turn on the flashlight and f-ck the whole idea of these levels. graphics wasn't improved. there is no normal shadows, which were promised years ago. lost mission is b-llsh-t. saving the game is broken too, now you must wait for seconds each time, it's annoying. as a result, once again, bethesda decided to earn money on unnecessary remake of good game, but this time, it's sh-t. i didn't give money on sh-t, be kind not to do it.",0

what really happend during the wild west..,1
best apocalypse simulator with showing war's cruel situation.,1
couldn't 'play' for longer than minutes.. looks more like someone's reel tan a real game. performance is very poor and all you can do is wander around clicking guys to see what nonses they have to say.. it's like going on clubbing to big non-interesting cool disco all by yourself .. avoid..,0
"at this point in time i cannot recommend a purchase. i truly enjoy the game, but the save function is horribly buggy. saving manually corrupts the save file more often than not and the autosave has issues as well. when i load my late year autosave, i somehow end up in early year . so for roughly hours the autosave was updating the stats shown on the save file in the load screen, but didn't touch the actual contents of what gets loaded, meaning that it not only screws you out of hours of gameplay, but you won't find out until you've already loaded.",0
"fantastic game and very addictive however, civilization v is too expensive on steam. bring down the price a bit. price's range from just . up to on various other sites. jungle .",1
dark storyline so i reccomend it for that but very simple,1
game keeps freezing. apparent problem with windows and . did everything posted on the forums to fix it with no luck. more frustrating than fun.,0
"played the game for months, unlocked tier v planes for every nation and reached the mid-ranks with some tanks. then gaijin sent me a message claiming i had used the steam refund system to refund money on a golden eagles purchase months after they claim the refund had happened. however, i have never used the steam refund system before. i couldn't find any record of it on my bank account and had to spent .- in the gaijin shop for war thunder in order to get my account back after it got frozen. after that i' am no longer interested in playing this game. not after the devs showed a poor ability in communcation and made accusations which i couldn't even defend rightfully. don't spent any money on this game, gaijin might ask you for more after you do",0
"the game was really good when i first tried it, no matter that i'm a noob and it still is, but now that it's paid i wouldn't recommend it, because it's not worth bucks. it was created to be free and making it paid is just stupid, because at the end of the day this is a free version of quake . there's no reason to pay for quake live, when you can just buy quake . the only plus side of live was the fact that you don't have to pay and now i don't see why you would buy it.",0
"i beat the game in minutes, i mean seriously? what kind of game is this?",0
i loved the game its fantastic and the enviorment is so well created and beautiful while i am still stuck on the puzzle's i personaly think this game was worth the dollars i payed for when it first came out,1
interesting. personally im more of a hands on gamer though.,0
"i'd really prefer that there was a 'meh' review.. as it stands, the variety of puzzles in the game is too slim, in that one particular mechanic auto-shifting platforms gets relied on almost too heavily throughout the game. the game is not long, and its ending is extremely forced. if the game were lower in price i might have fallen on the side of recommending, but as it stands there are better games to be found.",0
"cons buggy, grindy. repetitive pros good combat ideas. i play a lot of souls and i was told that this was a souls like gamr but it is missing to much polish for my taste.",0

"one of the best open world games i have ever played, the customization is as complex as ive ever seen, the story is surprisingly emotional and intense, game has a lot of great and witty humor, graphics of course are outdated but thats easy to overlook, and also has great and simple controls. my little brother and i used to play this game co op for hours upon hours a day and it is a memory i will always cherish",1
"this game is indifferent and does require any commitment to enjoy. i'm not sure why many people gave a positive review, and it feels like it was made by someone messing around one afternoon with a game-making program that promises 'much success, much monies and much women.' i could find better games than this on armorgames and other websites that offer similiar games. this is my only reason for buying this 'game' . profit",0
"i'm glad i got it free by having the original game bought for . otherwise, i would be asking for a refund immediately. the audio problems persist, but i can live with that. the problem is that the game crashes every minutes i have specs much better than the minimum required and corrupts your saves. the remaster basically sucks, i bet they haven't even tested it before releasing to the public.",0
"minutes. . hours. that's the most gameplay i got out of this game. for what, you ask? spoiler it's a lesbian who ran away from home. i could have gotten more out of but i didn't. i'm sure i spent of those minutes throwing everything out of their respected containers and completely trashing the place. seriously. it's a waste of money.",0
it is a great game i like it all and would recomend it.the micro payments can be an issue for some but if you don t mind to wait for a building to be constructed it is ok.after you get nd and rd zone and start expanding you re empire the game becomes a lot more interesting.the pvp aspect of the game is meh can be improved and the actual battles are bit too simplistic but overall i do recomend it .,1
"machinarium is so much fun. the world spread out before you is engaging, filled with robots who are really individuals. there's no cookie cutter characters here. the puzzles are challenging, but not impossible and the music provides the perfect backdrop to figure them all out.",1
so good i bought it for of my friends beacuse im rich,1
"if you want a diablo clone, this does the diablo experience as well as many. didn't feel like anything special, though.",1
keyboard delay second. game lag randomly. screen fixed at . best d game engine ever out of . i bet developers develop this game using windows .,0
there is no way to not enjoy jumping off of big ben with the parachute as commando and then gliding in on the enemy with a minigun,1
"although this games works i can't recommend it because years - fails to work at all and this is clearly an issue a lot of people have had with years -. and a major failure in this game is the complete lack of dialogue, the game may look like harry potter but it sure as heck doesn't feel like when you're playing it with the characters just moaning and groaning the whole time, i played for mins and just couldn't stand it anymore. i should have researched the games better here on steam to discover the problems people have had and to find out there's no dialogue from the movies so it's my own fault that i wasted money on these games. at least lego lord of the rings is much much better!",0
very little depth and no character progression found in typical rogue likes today. could not see anyone keeping engaged by this game for a long amount of time as there is not much really there to keep you playing.,0
plese stop music when i switch to desktop,1
"wanted to pick this game up and give it a try, wish i'd never even thought about it. worst buy i ever made. clunky ui terrible art overly complicated tutorial, reccomend everything else in my library over this.",0
"this game would be awesome, except for a few fatal flaws. . the cutscenes sound and video don't line up, and when the sound ends, you're greeted with a black screen which lasts for the remainder of the video. . glitchy and laggy, especially during boss fights. . fast travel takes so long to load that you might as well walk. overall, this feels more like a demo or maybe a work in progress, not a game that's been out for months. i wouldn't recomend this one to anyone i know. it can't even come close to comparing to the other two in the series.",0
best singleplayer fps. out of,1
-plays like a really bad flash game -controls are sluggish and awkward in all the wrong ways -hitting a target is far too random at times for this to be a top down shooter not worth any amount of money considering there are hundreds of flash games that play better than this and are free.,0
"great game, really fun! if you are a person wanting to buy this game, it is hard at first but as soon as you learn the game itself its awesome! great game for hisorty lovers and anyone who loves strategy games.",1
"this is a great game, trully remastered visually gorgeous. the game stays true to the original, i've died a bunch of times an had to start certain levels over again. i like a challegen in my games, if you like good old fun then this game is for you.",1
"i could have really enjoyed this game, if it actually worked. you have no control over when the game chooses to save, so you're basically just playing until it forces you to save in a situation which is untenable and you have to start over. supposedly this bug has been fixed as of this review -- i assure you it is not. fought stubbornly to the th level or so because i figured i might be able to power through it.. boy was i wrong. as an effect of 'gas vents' the game started saving every other move to finally hang up in an infinite loop of autosaving while my character was forced to be in stasis while making fuel cells. because stasis goes on for thousands of turns, and it seemed to be saving every turn to other turn at this point.. the game ground to a screeching halt. wish i could have solved the mystery -- but the game is broken.",0
having over hours of great fun it is a sad day that i say do not buy this game. the microtransactions that they promised never to implement have appeared and it makes a mockery of trying to achieve anything. i have told at least friends to buy this and we have all enjoyed heists..but this wills top now with the pay to win system put in,0
i don't know what type of net these guys have but my download speed is about kb s and i can connect to the servers. this is a pretty good point and click murder simulator.,1
fun ballistics for a free game. absurdly terrible game design for something you'd pay for. enemies spawn once you've crossed invisible thresholds so there is literally no point to scoping out areas before walking in extremely linear 'stealth sections' that are a complete drag due to poorly implemented mechanics and a hivemind ai. if one finds you everyone does at the same time,0
fantastic puzzle game that keeps you coming back. it's easy to clear a couple of critters but working towards that screen-clearing masterpiece is an insanely rewarding addiction. the visuals are bright and sharp and the music is so vivid that it almost becomes another character in the room. highly recommended,1
"i recommend terraria to people looking for an easygoing game where you don't worry about losing items because you can't. if your friends troll you i.e blow up your house ,take your armor, no need to worry ,if you start a new world ,you still keep your epic loot.i think terraria is great for people to relax and not worry about the harder things.",1
"the game is very short - took me hour to complete for the first time, on hardest difficulty by the way. handling is frustrating, especially on faster car which you need to buy anyway, it dosen't turn while pressing gas pedal. on that car gameplay consists of bouncing off invisible walls all the time. often you fly off the track and have to retire the race. and, most importanly, burning cars just isn't fun.",0
never got my premium . thanks.,0
"want to play mario party without the games that let you feel like you have agency? no? then don't play this game. in this game, you roll dice until someone wins. there is a central deck built with the cards you think everyone else can't use as well as you, mixed with another quarters of random junk thrown in by everyone else. so it doesn't help combat the randomness at all. oft times, you'll lose because you got a couple of bad rolls, or because you simply couldn't land on the right spaces and orbited the board until someone else won. not recommended.",0
"don't get me wrong. this game is good and you can sink many hours into it. but of the time, ai germany will steamroll everything. there is no way to stop them no matter what you do and that kinda makes the game dull as you can always guess the outcome.",0
"didn't think i'd like the game even though i'm a big batman fan but bought it anyway when it was on sale. i ended up enjoying the living hell out of it! great story, great atmosphere, great gameplay, great boss battles, great batman.",1
one of the greatest and funniest puzzle games i have played in years!,1
"having full experience granted us the thought of maybe we will get a full season and future seasons? episodes mm seems fair.. episodes changed to episodes? odd ok, its going well we are getting updates, the episodes for 'free' and some content! i decide to wait till the last episode and stumble on the store page.. is that a name change? a picture change? full experience to full season ? damn did we just get charged dollars for season only? not even season ? maybe i misread.. is that a price increase from dollars to ? dollars for episodes and reskinned bonus missions? no thanks, do not buy its a cash grab. they have turned this into a cash grabbing situation, i loved hitman but this is just terrible.. hell to the no will i pay more dollars for season . argue in the comments if you dickride square enix!",0
the game is great and all. but i told my friend about this and he wanted it but it was for pc only.,0
"i found myself questioning the gameplay direction the developers were going for. there were some interesting mechanics put into play like the special power up pick ups which turns you into a dog or a god that shoots projectiles out of his hand. i also like how at times the enemy can roll over to you and take your gun. everything else the game has to offer feels plain, dull or not something that should of coexist. i'm probably judging it too hard and the game is just not for me but if their goal was to have a simple shoot em up, i would prefer to play painkiller instead.",0
this game iss so old that its hurting my eyes lol btw i cant recored this game for some reason!!,0
"i'm always psyched to play this game, are you naut?",1
not worth it. waste of money.,0
was a really good shooter. now it's too hard to play it. they made a lot of updates and the game got harder and harder. - out of am disappointed,0
"for a game i thought i'd only play once, it's not that bad. i find myself fireing it up occasioanly when i want to play something light. while everyone seems to be buying this game just for the tf unlocks, this game would be something that could stand on it's own if it offered some sort of multiplayer mode, or a larger cast of characters.",1
", gt sale worth it",1
"i really want to feel like i can reccomend this game. the adaptive story is really kool, i love the visual style, and i respect what the developer was trying to do here. it's disturbing, it's detailed, and it certainly deserves the attention it's gotten, if not more. i've only got complaints. for one thing, the controls are awkward. this isn't such a big deal, it just feels a little clunky at times. the second complaint, on the other hand, is a deal breaker for me. this game is just not very scary. it's really not. even playing it at night, with headphones on and the lights off failed to scare me. don't get me wrong, it's got it's moments, but they are few and far-between. i never thought that playing a game about a man losing his grip on reality in the zombie apocalypse would bore me. maybe it gets better later on, but after giving it . hours to get good, i think it's reasonable to lose faith. it could still be your thing though, it's got a lot of promise. just didn't quite do it for me.",0
i always enjoy a good adventure game. this one looks to satisfy.,1
can't get passed the tutorial. quit when the intructor dude kept repeating 'fail again. have another try.' pressing the right keys and the dummy is not doing anything. i might try it again some other day.,0
this is a very cool game that has engaged my logic and has sarcasm for amusement as well. i will be playing this alot more now.,1
this game is awful. zombies lag and freeze.,0
"i'd only recommend at a or higher sale, the graphics aren't that good but in koei games it's more about gameplay. the fighting is fun and you can explore a lot of characters and the story doesn't differ much from the game, except they left out some details from the actual one piece anime. you see some sad cutscenes but there's too little character development to actualy feel something. except if you've seen the anime the character will refer to some things you will not understand if you do not know the backstory. i've seen other people having problems with the graphics and bugs, but i haven't seen any at the moment. the controls were in the beginning a bit confusing but you'll get used to it.",1
crashes a lot on my modern system. couldn't get through it because the constant crashing annoyed me too much.,0
"i felt like i was waching a short movie more then playing the game.. i loved s but s by the looks of it going to be a flop.. if you really love the walking dead, then wait for all ep's to come out before buying.",0
"it said simply chess , but wasn't so simple",0
"this is an interesting game in terms of the story line and the level of creepiness. having said that, the limitation of not being able to freely move around is slightly annoying, however it might serve the purpose of attacks by ghosts. however this is certainly not worth paying . as there is not much content to the game!",1
welcome to the warz. the zombies decided they ruined the world and they flew away with the super zombie to mars and in the process they broke the sky and it shattered. now you have to fight aliens. this game breaks the record for not letting new people enjoy confusing ui and just so many bad stuff that shouldnt exist oh well what can we expect from a company like this. edit played a bit of their new game mode. even worse. it tries to copy h z king of the kill and no i am not butthurt by that it looks exactly and it has the same idea with nothing uniqe in it. its warz with h z 's king of the kill.,0
"repetitive gameplay, and unoriginal graphic style. the game's concept is very intresting, but tires quickly. best played in min segments.",0
its a waste of time and a big disapointment when you get the first mission and the graphs suck marvel can do better then this,0
arma is very relistic. deff not a run and gun type of game. but best feature of all is breaking point zombie mod. the mod works great,1
hired by men to kill a monster kill a monster kill some men too then i ride my horse roach and go up a mountain find a cave with trolls try and reason with trolls so that i dont kill them then i sleep and repeat but with more intense the witcher wild hunt is the best game i have ever played and knowing that it will be the last is so sad. truely a game everyone should own.,1
warning!! do not buy unless you want to spend loads of money!! -this game is pay win without a doubt. -you have to play for hours just to unlock free stuff. -pay play players get better guns and armour than you. -steam should stop selling this awful 'category' of 'f p' games.,0
"one of the best metroidvania games i've played since metroid fusion. just about every aspect of this game was a blast, from the gameplay, the art style, sense of humor, and fantastic taste in music.. just play it, worth the price. it'll make ya say 'i'm gonna puma pants'.",1
bought this game sight-unseen because i loved ittle-dew so much. they could have charged for this game and it would still be a bargain.,1
"suffering from an uncomfortable ui and more important lots of bugs, both in game play and the program itself. it could be good once these issues are addressed.",0

"i know my basics and have beaten most magic games on pc without much difficulty, but this game.. the story mode is a utter disaster, extremely luck based. there s nothing i can do or change in my lilianas campaign. it s simply infuriating.",0
"do not make the same mistake i did i have descended into the dark pit of dlc, but i have returned and now life is sweeter because i have jelly beans - negative review pre-update post update they have fixed it, we are free from the mischievious microtransactions. let us celebrate dear brothers for a new era has come! at least.. for a little while.. as the trump times are approaching. so let us celebrate while we can brothers!! let us steal all the drugs and gold possible while we still can!! for justice!!",1
"honestly the best batman game, the level of details in this game is phenomenal, you can see how much effort has been put into to make this game as it is. the story line is very intriguing and the combat is satifying, though there may be some learning curves and there are so many, so many combos and play styles you can choose to develope. i would recommend to try different things because they implemented a lot of cool combos finishes you can use. it's definetly a must have to any fans of batman. p.s. ignore the overall reviews for this game, it had some initial release problems on the pc port, but it runs almost flawlessly now, just like any other previous batman games, however it does require a beefy rig to run on max settings.",1
i played orginal game it was great but this game is too lagging not like the other,0
"the controls, however simple, seem backward, and there is no way to change that in the controls only how fast they go backward. i wouldn't recommend it, but that doesn't make it a horrible game. have fun with it. it certainly is a game.",0
even after all this time it's a mess.,0

"a fun game with the most intensely toxic community i've ever seen, and that includes dotas. out of th of my random games are just people screaming the n word and kicking me after min of me being in the top of the team in vs . on the other hand, that game was really amazing and everyone had fun!",1
after playing the disaster that was sim city this ia breath of fresh air.,1

"if you thought that the biggest problem with diablo iii was that it wasn't diablo ii lord of destruction with a skill customization system, a -node passive skill tree and nifty new zealand accents, i have some great news for you! not so great for your career, relationships, hygiene, or mouse buttons though.",1
nice game to spend a rainy day on. you can waste hours going on trips across europe,1
this is probably of my favourite episodes so far?,1
"i don't understand all the positive reviews. i haven't played gothic, so i have no emotional bonding with the game, maybe that doesn't help. i found the story and the dialogue and the quests and the music all boring. i also don't like the fact that fighting is so difficult, i understand that this could also be a very positive thing challenge-wise, but i just got frustrated, because i'm a bit ocd when it comes to wolves on my path, i want them out of my way no matter what. i understand i am to leave stronger enemies alone, to save them for later. i can't do that. there's really nothing abut the game that makes me want to try and just finish it. no. just..no. boring and frustrating game, is all i can say.",0
"i played the game not on my steam version. i have over hours on non steam version. this game is pretty good, but it has bugs creative never fixed. the naval combat is amazing and computers nowadays can finally run it properly. this is probably the best total war game made, except maybe shogun .",1
one of the single most addicting games to date it's amazing though the only thing i hate in the game are the races everything else is top notch.,1

"arma is still better, even this far after arma 's release.",0
"this game literally created the most intense nerdy experience i have ever had the luxury to have. it's free, it's brilliant with friends you'll laugh, you'll cry get it!",1
"star crusade is like if hearthstone and starcraft had a baby. you have the fun and core gameplay of hearthstone and the theme of starcraft, including humans with gadgets, religious aliens and an bug-like lady that i still hit any day. but don't think is just a copy-paste, because the game has its little unique features. i hope the devs expand the concept without leaving the game broken or unfun.",1
this is a really awesome game! it has a lot of character customizations along with different maps to play on and a extreame amount of acheivements to earn. great game.,1
this game has a perfect combat system in my eyes its very fun and it can be great for everybody there is a problem though its that the people don't play this anymore and it makes things very boring but it still has aton of people who play this still and all people need to do is join the game understand all the amazing things in it if you put about hours in this you will see the charm with the interactive enviorment of most the maps every class can be very special and all the classes can be very enjoyable i never played a game like this and i hope it does not die out it can be played by tons of people who have bad computers for exaple i can hold - gb and i can run this game in perfect frames steam needs to make this game get noticed because its very diferent and more original than tons of games on steam,1
game ending crashes. constant game ending crashes that prevent any progress.,0
"this was a drunk purchase and an excelent one at that. puzzles that challange and a good story to boot. this runs beautifully on my linux machine. the graphics, the sounds, gameplay, everything is just a solid all around nice package. this is a must if you are into these types of games.",1
"this is the only game that gets worse the more i play it, im not buying dlcs that should be with the org. release of the game also their online matchs are way over or under balanced, tactics are out the window just buy good command options. wish it was more like the org.",0
"good game to play.. with friends! if you enjoy mmo's by yourself, be my guest, there is plenty to do. me? i'd personally play with friends as it is much more fun. also once you've done all of the real quests, there is not a whole lot to do unless you want to invest in the game. overall a good game, but not alone.",1
"lagged through out the whole game, had no idea what was going on, worst game ever! if u want to waste your money, buy this game",0
"if you are thinking 'oh, another banal tower defense', well, you are wrong. i am not myself a fan of tower defense games, but sanctum is another story. very intriguing, it is a real pleasure to play. consider it!",1
cant even launch the ing game,0
not the game i thought it would be,0
"good software that helps you make your ideas into games in a fairly easy way. although it would be nice to have more tutorials videos help to get started as you are left to your own devices, there are plenty of videos out there that are really helpful. there is a help section if needed, but once you know what a tool does it's not too bad. script is the hardest thing on here if you've never done it before, however it's not too bad to pick up once you've started and again i found videos help too ! worth giving a go, there's lots of dlc and if you want to even try transfering your own drawings etc into the game.",1
"so there's really not much to say. a solid first-person combat game, that takes the monotony out of playing every shooter in existence. built on ue , it's a great engine, a great game, and a very fun experience. well worth the time and money though buy it on sale if you can .",1
"the physics in this game are awful. hoopsvr is the gold standard and this game doesn't even get the bronze. it feels more like you're throwing a shopping bag than a basketball. very disappointed. hopefully they can work on this and make it feel more realistic. right now, throwing a full court shot feels exactly like throwing a foot shot. awful.",0
looking at the trailer and pictures. i assumed it was going to be good and it was a major dissapointment for me. the fps wasnt the most stable in my opinion. i couldn't use my xbox controller on the game and had to use my keyboard and mouse. from using my keyboard and mouse i will say that it is not totaly bad on the account of doing certain things as far as baisic movements in combat. wish it woud have been better. i'd rather play the division or maybe even rainbow six seige than this game.,0
"amazing game, couldn't live without it. wish there were brits in a dlc or something though. looks like they did add the brits! cheers!",1
the game is smooth enough when it runs but the gameplay gets repetetive fast,0
"looks good but its more a drive through tunnel simulator than it is a space simulator. voice acting is terrible, its buggy as hell. don't buy this.",0
"the first few hours aren't quite compelling, the combat is somewhat generic even though you use awesome superheroes. i haven't done much, and wasn't hooked.",0
"absolute console garbage. for some reason, this game was included as the 'early' unlock in the august humble monthly. god only knows why. to top it off, it is the multiplayer only version of the game. the demo i suppose? humble bundle is balls now.",0

game wont even download correctly and no one has any help on this. this is done with very bad programming and dont waste your time trying to download this itll never work,0
basically this game and me have a love hate relationship. the ai is kinda . the sige wall lag bug can ruin what should be epic battles. otherwise it is fun. i have over hours on this account and on my other account which is locked to to steam not appreciating my racial humor had over . worth buying on sale. never a bad choice of youre bored.,1

"if your competative, and love to kill zombies in multiple ways, then look no further this game is for you. you have an excellent story mode, available to be played co-op with three other players but you also get competative online gaming, and even 'call of duty waw zombie mode' where you literally are thrown into a level, and told to survive for as long as possible. however unlike the cod version where you have 'rounds' this is a timed event with no breaks! how long can you survive? can you get gold? there is also a competative side, where you can play and battle against other players to do objectives, i.e. you can play storymode while being hunted by zombies that are players! you can also play a mode where your goal is to fill up a machine with gas, while players as zombies try to stop you. a worthwhile buy, great fun with friends and even with randomers.",1
"horrible, the mac version is bugged as , dont even buy if you own a mac.",0
"just in case any of the devs read this more meaningless content doesn't mean more fun! reduce the stupid item-collecting and make games fun again. i am pretty doubtful that after a hour campaign of great action and puzzle-solving anyone would say i am going to downvote that game because it was lacking of another hours of running around and collecting leaves and feathers. no feathers, no fun. thumbs down! so please stick with the actual content. and yes, if anyone wants to pay real money for outfits and other dlc-crap, it's up to you to publish additional moneymakers. have fun on your pile of gold. i grant it to you, for real! but don't annoy us players ingame with wasting time and making an otherwise good game 'average'. because that's what it became thanx to the content, content, content, content, content, content.. the mantra of games nowadays. it sucks!",0
where did the time go,1
"really atmospheric cyberpunk platformer chapters , various enemies and traps, simple but thrilling story of a killer who trying to save his wife you can run fast through stages and leave all enemies behind or smash every face on your way you will die. a lot. not a reason to stop, you are an artist, aren t you ? time-dilation ability normal amp hardcore mode in addition awesome artwork and great soundtrack the only thing made me sad - delays between voice sentences, bit long and makes speech unrealistic finally , a cyberpunk game that worth to be played.",1
"although short, there is a lot to dig through if you look for it. but that depends on whether or not you're into the metal gear lore. bonus points for rendering cut-scenes in real-time and although some mechanics along with controls are simplified there is still some challenge to it. to it's core, it's a nice, polished sand-box stealth-centric game.",1

"a nice science fiction horror isometric point and click game. part fo the fun in the game is to fail and get yourself killed in many funny ways a horro scify theme that makes you want to read all the pdas to get background info on what happened on the ship. lots of crepy crawlers to keep ya wanting the lights on when you are playing. a good buy, took me hours to run the course of it.",1
the game would be fine if not for the many bugs i've encountered. after it's patched i will give it a proper review.,0
monkey porn in a nutshell,1
"hit detection is wonky, which is enough to be a death knell for a game where it's so important. aside from that, it's very grindy. very, very grindy. the banter is incredibly bad, it makes me grind my teeth. enemies and levels are uninteresting. i really have no excuse for having played it as much as i have. i can't think of a single thing about it that i like. get payday or even l d instead.",0

great story awesome excting fun intence dramatic just dont play the multiplayer i was level it put me as admin and every weapon unlocked so i had to contact steam about it great game love the story never play the multiplayer,1
spess mehrens we have fehled the empra,1
i enjoyed game. pros challenging good concept.,1
even for the interface is much too glitchy and unpredictable. object placement is so painful and elusive i spent minutes trying to place a bathroom stall and sink. i wanted to play a ground up restaurant simulator but i never got past the bathroom.. i recommend avoiding unless you'relooking for a tool to measure your patience.,0
"dont buy dead game, multiplayer servers are gone.",0
love the game having lots of fun!,1
this is a must buy for anyone that likes hardcore fps games. the game is not only a great looking game but all the movements and combat are awesome. and lets not forget the one thing that the developers gave us that the big boys wont and that is true dedicated servers.,1
"alright, i played it offline and online for a little bit more now. sometimes, for me, the blue squares don't spawn. so you just run and run and run. like, what? is it just me?",0
"if you download this game you will find important things lag,cheaters, and, the most important of all, uninstall button. just..nope, it doesn't deserve to be played",0
"for a loadout on a single toon? ahahahahahahahahahahaha..wait. they are serious. ahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahaha first match impressions what is all the lag? why am i being shot from across the map in the spawn zone? why am i against lv players when i just joined? oh, i'm dead. ok lets respaw-dead again..kay.. hackerfest bros, stay out of it.",0
this game is simply amazing. i love it! definitely a must get. amazing story line amp beautiful graphics. lara is such a badass character! this is definitely one of my top favorite games that i've played.,1
a revolutionary sandbox game. groundbraking gameplay. amazing graphic upgrade compared with gta . voice acting. good plot. decent variety of vehicles and weapons. replay value.,1
out of cake tease sim - spoilers theres no cake i hate this game forever i want the cake. other than that it was great.,1
"if you just want to play the main game and stop there and ignore the postgame, then it's okay, i guess. nothing special though, but decent fun. some good atmosphere, some decent puzzles, a pretty decent-sized world to explore. the post-game, though, feels like something that was thrown together in a few hours and they didn't bother to test it or fine-tune it at all. it's easy to get stuck and have to warp back to the nexus, the challenges tend to be tedious and unfun without being really hard in a legitimate way, and the world loses a lot of its charm when you just want to friggin' be done already. i went from 'meh' to 'despise' on this game pretty quickly and i can't say i'd recommend it for a good gaming experience. oh yeah, and. the game is really pretentious and tries to be super creepy but it ends up trying way too hard and i'm so done with the 'spookiness' pretty quickly into it. gag me.",0
"good game, good expansion, development for the chars they introduced in the first ee. ignore the brigades by the degenerates known as 'gamer gate', thus the low score. buy it if you like baldur's gate, don't buy it if including a single transgender character, and a single innocent joke about gamer's gate is enough to make you lose your bearings and diaper contents all over the internet.",1
another bad console port to pc. menus are a pain. keys are a pain.,0
this game is amazing! nice pixelart and insainly difficulty levels. also has a really fun multiplayer mode!,1
this is easily the second most fun i have pretending to be goat. right behind that time in thailand.,1
well i guess you all know the game play so i skip that. i would recommend the game if it would not constantly crash.. seriously rockstar do you even qa? if i would be responsible for such a bug ridden pos software i would resign my job out of pure shame..,0
"i find my self getting really bored playing this game. if you like to craft thing's mine thing's, i guess it's a game for you i find it confusing and a total waist of time, it pretty much looks like some thing form the s. nothing wrong with that so ive only played a short time ill collect my cards and erase it, if you get it on sale maby worth . but it's not a game my opinion .. yeah i'm going to get alot of hate from my opinion but's it's mine.. not a game for me..",0
"this is one of my all time favourite games. at first the controls were very odd to me, but after practice i got the hang of it. it was great playing all of the modes all the way through and fun to play with friends. each character has a certain strength in my opinion which made it easy for me to lean towards which i prefer. candyman who can jump hella high i love that yellow headed er to bits.",1
very good team based game,1
"this game is phenomenal - i played for dozens of hours on the ipad, and now am building up my restaurant from scratch on the pc. can't wait for csd !",1
"i grew up with this being a game i wasted a lot of time on, upon seeing it realesed on steam my only thoughts were along the lines of 'oh, they've updated the graphics and made this playable on some far more advanced machines then what i was using way back when' but damn i was wrong, i ended up downloading it to one of my older computers and it works fine but it's such a hassle just to go out of my way to play this on one of my severly out-dated computers, if they ever go about making this work on superior computers then by all means i'll give this a thumbs up but until then, unless you still have a computer that runs like those in , just avoid this game",0
"i'm sorry man, but this game just stinks. the tactical combat is kind of solid, but in every other respect it's just a boring, tedious, uninteresting pile of poop. slogging through horribly written dialog, pixel hunt quests, and the most tedious looting treasure system i've seen in ages. bad. hearing all , lines of horrible dialog instead of reading them honestly doesn't improve the experience.",0
"boring as . regret buying. you overkill, too much god damn grinding.",0
this is the best ever driving game with amazing scenery.,1
guns guns guns. tigers are playing to-night. i never miss a game.,1
"had some bugs in the beginning, game kept freezing, but after some restarts this was fixed. games runs fine and is really fun to play!! worth the money",1
i hope people out there will read this before buying this game. despite being out for years this game is still plagued with bugs. from black screen during loading to random freezing in game just google heroes vi and you will see the horde of problems . i highly recommend everyone out there to avoid this game. i did not read the reviews beforehand and made this bad purchase. hopefully this will serve as a warning to others to avoid this game!,0
"ho-hum what to say about dino d-day.. well in theory any game that employs dinosaurs and nazi's together in the same game should be an automatic hit right? not the case here. the game is horribly imbalanced towards the axis teams favor, allowing like different dinos for them and only one for the allies. guess who wins most matches the community is almost non-existant , so get ready to be availible for that magic hour when theres only enough people for a small game . which is very rare it's really just a poorly put together source mod that should have been purchased cheap buy valve and given free to the steam community. i.e smashball, dystopia , synergy etc. game has such potential but fails on so many levels its only worth - on sale if that",0
"great free game ruined by scumbag company jagex and dead now, stay away.",0
"got rich, became the richest guy in the universe. still don't know how i have endless supply and endless demand.",1
"it's a cool game but i can't seem to truly get into it. yes, it's fun but it doesn't hook me. it's too much of a clickfest and that really annoys me. there are too many abilities to click and you're constantly outnumbered - which is fine but all those enemies spam abilities too. i just simply don't like it. it's cool and has a cool setting and is fun but i just can't enjoy it with the spamming and the clickfest type gameplay.",0
"there are many bugs, such as soldiers shooting through walls, falling through roofs and similar things but on the whole it is a good and fun game. xcom is challenging. enjoy",1
never liked basketball before now i love it! and understand how to finally play! well on pc anyway !,1
"worst jrpg i ever play. no challenge, no storie, no fun..",0
"honestly, after playing this for a little while, it's a lot more clunky than most games of the genre type. the controls are clunkier, the fact that certain things require tools to get and it's automatic instead of organic in nature is a bit annoying. it's an okay game for something made in rpg maker yeah, i know the engines quite well having used them for the last, oh, years but it was always going to be clunkier than anything made in a more versatile engine. i mean, you could actually make something more like stardew valley using rpg maker but that would require a lot more effort than just making everything automatic based instead. i'm not sure i like this game much, sorry, but eh, i've played a lot worse. it's decent, just the whole lack of feeling like you have any control bugs me a lot. i like the hm and rf series and this is pretty inferior in comparison. not bad but not good either.",0
"it's said war - war never changes. men do, through the roads they walk. and this road.. has reached its end.",1
"this game is very good. it's a turn-based squad tactical game, but also has base management, but in a way you haven't seen before. anyway, it's good, so buy it yo.",1
very short and sweet. had to check with doctor for diabetes. very sweet,1
"so it took hours to download from steam. after i was done downloading it, i had to install the freaking game that took another hours to do. i played it for a bit and it was generic af. wasnt immersive, boring looking, the gameplay was alright but definitely not worth . i had only been playing for minutes and i had enough. i wanted a refund but was denied because when the game installs, it counts as if you're actually running it so i already had hours of gameplay when did not. it was a complete waste of dollars that i could've used for csgo skin. i advise you do research about the game so you know exactly what you're getting into.",0
"within seconds of installation, this game blew out my speakers with the moaning of anime girls. out of , would scare the neighbors again.",1
"this game is a overall masterpeice. from the fluent daily objectives and jobs, to working on escaping. even though there may be some problems due to the servers, but it is still quite smooth gameplay. some of the aspects i like about this game are, the fact that it is so easy to save your game and exit, crafting can be challenging to remember but a quick visit to google will do the trick.",1
"have to say, for what it cost, kind of a let down. the old might and magics from what i remember you got to keep your hero and build. this constantly changing your hero and taking your stuff from you crap is kind of a 'gimme my friggin money back' game changer. you took away one of the basic kick features of m and m with that crap. i was looking for adventuring and building with a toon that i got to customize. what was given was a new face and stolen gear every map. if you're looking for classic might and magic game play, this is not what you were looking for. total thumbs down, wishing i'd bought the new fallout or something instead now.",0
"if you like fps games where you are semi-invincible, have worthless ai companions, and play in a tiny area bound by invisible walls, this game is for you! play rainbow six, then ask yourself, what if they did that to a game like this? came out like a decade ago with just about the same graphics the concept of planning and organizing a heist has great potential, i have no idea why they thought doing things in this way was a great decision, but then again the general gaming public will eat it up regardless. out of",0
"disappointed in the anti-cheat, fromsoft banning legit players for unknowingly dueling with hackers is attrocious and this negative review won't budge until the anti-cheat is fixed.",0
if you like games where every single level makes you wanna cry and even if you somehow pass it you find next one that is x more ed up than previous one its perfect title for you. checkpoints are placed in many points but some parts are so hard that you play screens for over an hour and still no luck. good game but only if you have patience for it.,1
"i have loved all of the might and magic games but this one would be good but it is big i mean rilly big, and on top of that it has a very hard time running even on a good pc that sead i like it but it runs like !!",0
"not a bad game, by an means, a bit overpriced with all the dlcs. great time waster, requires a modicum of skill to get the hang of, no tutorial or real practice mode, and the only way to see the character moves is in the single player character select screen. if you're looking for a hi-quality fighting game this isn't it, but if you're looking for something fun to waste time with every now and again, catch it on sale and its awesome.",1
not very good but if you want a free zombie killing game this can be the one for you.,0
it's not perfact but is more than your average free to play it has some frustraiting mechanics such as not being able to directly target hostiles i can recomend those who like these kind of games but for eveyone else not so much it takes all your money away for the sake in you spending money to get more gold,0
"at first, the game was in too poor of a state to play, and i would not recommend it. now, after some time, it turned out to be a great game. freely build your own trade empire, or battle fleet to take over someone elses outpost . the story line is terrible, so if you want a good story, don't buy this game. but if you've read anything about this game, you know its not ment to be played for the story. overall, it had a rocky launch like most games for the past year , but it's matured into something that is great fun.",1
this one was a tough call for me. the music is awesoem. i love the way it changes when youre in combat. the environments are really nice and just pleasant to be in. the story didn't do much for me but it was above average for a videogame i suppose. the graphics are really pretty. i love the way the plants sway back and forth. little touches like that are great. unfortunately what brought the game down was the combat. a lot of my attacks didn't connect even though my weapon was right on the guy. gunplay was slightly better but it seems like it was designed for a controller instead of a gamepad. it also felt like the bad guys barely reacted to being shot which was kindof lame. i wouldn't recommend it at this point but if theres ever a free demo i'd recommend giving it a try.,0
brill game not to mutch money fun and user friendly,1
great game. i played many hours and had a great time. worth the some bucks it cost.,1
this game is good and i will make it great again votecorruptgaster notundertaletrash future,1

"i tried three times to describe in detail how this game was truly amazing and unique. failed each time. it's just beyond words. in the end, i can only say that it was truly a privilege to experience this story.",1
horrible. extremely wanna be gta.,0
okay so this game is completely a wreck. there are so many glitches and bugs and the interface is crap. the playstyle is crap. i have no idea why i wasted hours playing this game. i thought it would get better.. i really did.. well it didn't. . out of,0
"heartfelt, and sometimes cheesy, throwback to the greats. and it's done with pinache.",1
"i'm not planning on giving any money to , starbreeze, or overkill",0
singleplayer feels very average. the multiplayer on the other hand is awesome. tournaments are fun and people are generally friendly to noobs. i recommend buying this if you intend to play online.,1
"i loved this game on xbox and that was still one of my favorite gaming experiences ever - played it for years! but i wasted on the pc version cuz even with the graphics and resolution turned all the way down, still too stodgy to enjoy on my rig - and also horrible looking at that point. should've shopped more carefully. i won't mention which game bundle i wish i would've bought instead but.. hint would have supported steam more directly.",0
an excellent software to update your drivers for windows.,1

"great until game tries guilt you into buying guns. there is gun dlc, there is helicopter dlc, and there is even go-kart dlc. you need to pay dollars to not get popups about buying the dlc.",0
"fun game to play for the story of arkham island. what drew me in the most was the interesting and cryptic lore that is scattered about. the fight sequences are not the greatest as most others have said, it turns into button mashing after the first couple of guys. the story was ok but it wasn't really 'open world' because you fight this guy, move on to this guy, then this guy, then this guy, etc. there wasn't much of an open world feel that you could accomplish things in the order you wanted. you even get 'reminded' when you aren't following the plot fast enough when trying to do some exploring. i did like the game and would recommend it just for the story and background into the other games. don't pay a lot for it though.",1
"bought this game with the pack fc-fc -fcbd-fc but i can't play it now because you have to register the game on uplay to play it. if you want to buy it, go on uplay. it would be better.",0
game sucks as cs go,0
"i don't remember much of this game, which isn't a good sign.",0
"make your way through mind bending puzzles while listening to the best bad guy ever, as they make you laugh with the best lines ever.",1
"wayforward once again delivers one of the best platformers of the decade and nobody ing buys it. why do you, the consumer, do this to wayforward? all they want to do is make good games.",1
"you would be mad to buy this game.. this game is best suited for your dishwasher or hanging in your car.. unlike the others who purchased the game before me, i have been waiting to play this game for a month. unfortunately, it is completely broken.. i have lost faith in company that developed this game.. dont ever think of buying this game or anyother game from this developer!! steam should remove it from their library!!",0
"i will not buy dlc in order for this game to get better. no game on release should be this buggy, limited on content, and a poor script for the ai! like are you guys worried that we'll actually think while playing this cookie cutter! why even have a release date when you're not even gonna finish what you've started paradox. oh i know why.. because you are a piker. just like all the rest of your customers the lets players don't count . they'll press their fat putrid faces against your stretchmarked taint and inhale. you polished it, but you didn't make it intricate. you didn't make a grand strategy game that needed more than just the usual modifiers. my speculation. you were too worried about releasing your game on time. your fanbase is limited, more waiting wouldn't of been an issue. but now you have shamefully created false taste. you will keep adding on to the game until it eventually starts rejecting its entire anatomy.",0
the foundations update is a good start.. hopefully they keep the ball rolling.,1
"this game is good, i enjoyed playing it but probably wont be playing very much anymore, and here is why. matchmaking seems unbalanced. i got very lucky and opened diamond cards hearthstones legendary equivalent in the first week. it isn't enough facing opponents that are playing - legendary cards per game on top of the multitudes of rare and epics . the grind is real. you can earn only gold through quests, and ish through wins, which is equal to pack. i am getting burned out of the game before i can open new packs. the quests are fast, and will probably only play for the quests. but then i run into the first problem again, making me not want to play this is the biggest reason i dont feel like playing much anymore . i really dislike hearthstones free play model, and this feels very similar to it.",0
"i've played it a little, it's good!",1
"sometimes, things transcend languages. cute girls are one of them. i am biased, but this is a good visual novel. somethings are predictable, others not so much. still, it has good pacing in two languages. don't know what more you can reccomend a visual novel for. anyways, i hope you give it a try, if for no other reason than its a free game. and given the amount of content put into this, i'm surprised that they did not try to charge for it. there have been other visual novels that were far less interesting that cost far more. anyways, give this a shot. you could very easily enjoy yourself.",1
"kickarse game, makes me want to buy a real truck!",1
you can play it real life if u go to america !!,1
this is a amazing game and well worth the asking price.,1
"totally awesome game! lots of different guns and gadgets! it s free and you should be playing it right now! my favourite game of all time. i played the beta version, i have played it more than hours on xbox and it s still fun to play it. i know that the matchmaking system doesn t work so well, but i have always found a match after trying to find a match couple times. download this awesome game, because it s freakin awesome!",1
"short, but satisfying. the puzzles are challenging enough to make you think, but not to the point of frustration. the characters were fun, and the voice acting captured their personalities well. the story kept me glued to my keyboard. all in all, a good game. i look forward to seeing more from this team.",1
this game sucks. tons of glitches and bugs. can't even bind my keys on a pc game. what a joke. requested for refund.,0
lame game with very little to do after a few mins. not worth playing even for a free game.,0
"my friend and i got this game for the 'mmo' feature. it's a total fake. i understand it was a joke, but it's basically a scam if they sell it as an mmo. if you're gonna buy this for the mmo part, then do not buy.",0
"another badass zombie killing game gt d. if you played left dead, resident evil, dead rising, cod bo zombies, house of the dead, or any other zombie game then u should give this one a shot!",1
"this game really is tremendous and one of my enjoyed games to date. from every game you play their is something to be learned and how to counter a problem you face or how quickly you should respond to certin threats. for example a british motor emplacment will obliterate your front line if you dont make the equipment squads to take it out. also hats off to the game makers for making a in game currency where you can buy dlc with that instead of plain cash. to all players who may want to buy this game, you will most likley get rekt in your first games, theirs alot to learn and how other people play. even with the hours i've spent on this game, a max rank will punish me if i'm not up to scratch. stategy is great, graphics are great. out of would use close the pocket ability and level the entire map destorying everything the enemy had, breaking the dead-lock and conceding defeat immediatly.",1
"what a blast, literally! sanctum balances the tower defense and fps elements quite well, and never removes you from the first person view aside from that whole respawn delay thing if you manage to die . support towers allow you to pick up and place generated items like slow fields and mines even where towers wouldn't be allowed. up to players in a cooperative match also adds to the experience, and the difficulty scales or at least it seems to . if the game is too easy, or if you're looking for more end-game experience, you get credit for each 'feat of strength' earned by completing a level with the option turned on the feats are options for increasing the game difficulty, and can be used in any combination.",1
"payday , or 'what happens when left dead meets point break movie'. not as good as the aforementioned valve title, it's still very enjoyable expecially if played with friends, and overkill updates the game very often so the time this game will become abandoned is yet to come. there are still some cheaters around, but overall if you want some hot shot action and a lot of upgradable weapons.. here you go.",1
"fun and well-made, but it gets pretty samey. you fight the same handful of enemies in room after room, exploration seems pointless due to the lack of collectibles, unlockable moves feel like the same old thing in a new direction now you can attack up! , and the story is pretty generic bland. i've played for six hours and still feel like i'm in the early part of the game where you can't do anything yet. all that aside, the controls are tight, the combat is fun, the art is spot-on, and the costumes system is great. i like playing as samus aran in a beat-'em-up.",1
hours in and i still haven't built past k population. best game in my steam library of games.,1
need more bosses out of need more monsters! out of need workshop mods! out of overall best pixelated game ever.,1

"so my friend and i both got tf back when it was in the orange box and i played that for about years. then my pc died and i didnt play it for years then got a new pc and started playing it again it was still good. then i stoped playing it for about an other year, came back to it about months ago game was still good. then the update came out out of and the game is now a copy of csgo dont get this once great game its now really bad. if they change it back to the way it was i would tell people to get it but now no",0

"an unprecedented emotional experience. the game has a pretty unique relationship with what is known as the forth wall , not just making jokes with it, but even making game mechanics and plot points with it in baffling ways. every trope relating to rpgs and anything that frequently goes with them is brought up at some point. the uniquely strange writing does a great job at making the player laugh. the game also messes with your head a lot. the neutral ending boss made it feel like the game was playing me. assuming you're doing a true pacifist run, undertale is about finding humanity in unexpected places. the themes of the story are timeless, can be appreciated by all ages, and are well-executed. i know that gushing about this game has become a bit of a clich , but i went into it skeptical that it could be any good and came out feeling that this was the greatest work of art of the century. there are just no words anyone can type that do it justice. play it without spoilers. play it by yourself. play it without any sort of expectations.. in spite of my review.",1
the game is full of hackers online,0

"spent hours trying to work out how to start the game, out of still have not played it.",0
"the game is worth but make sure you do your research. some people are saying that the game has lag spikes but other people are saying that the game is fine if you have a good enough computer. everything seems to be working with minimum lag spikes here and there except for multiplayer. if it is the game's issue, hopefully they fix it soon. if you like fast paced shooter games, this is the game for. i've played black ops and all the call or duties since then. this is my favorite after black ops . wall running can be little difficult to get used to because it introduces a huge you way to play. if you play like you did in the previous black ops games, you will be a major disadvantage. i enjoy the game so far on pc just hopefully they fix the lag spikes if it is the game causing it. i would recommend it.",1

"i would say that this is one of the best games so far. i love the graphics, the game engine and all the little things that makes this game so real. i know that of the people are complaining about the banns of using mods and i understand it. it really pisses of when you have spent alot of money for this game and it kicks you right into balls when you are having a little bit of fun, but why still so many people are installing the mods and playing gta online with mods. it doesn't surprise me at all that rockstar is banning people for using mods in public servers. if they don't do it, you wouldn't play gta online because it would be full of cheaters and hackers. please spend that one minute in your life and think.. you can play safely with mods in singe player, but remember to delete them before you enter gta online!",1

"interesting game mechanics similar to far cry in the aspect of taking over strongholds and other various points on the map however that's pretty much all you end up doing area's may look different but it's a rehash of the same events. this game sadly fails to capture the grittiness of the previous title which is a missed opportunity on the developers part. you geniunely feel no attachment to any character or the struggles america is going through this entire game. as the previous title you had a lot of gut churning moments at how monsterious an invading force can be however it's downfall was how short the game was. despite it being free over the weekend i personally have played enough to say i won't be purchasing the game as i've experienced all the game has to offer for me, i didn't have a chance to play the multiplayer aspect of it but i don't feel like i am missing out on much, i'd say it's a out of kept my attention for a bit and the appeal wore off shortly after.",0
"the first thing to know is that this isn't xcom. it is made by the same company, but it is a spin off that is attempting to break new ground and take the tactic and strategical components from the main franchise and transition them to a first person shooter. it.. i mean it exists. to be frank, this is neither a good nor bad game. it's just kinda there. the buereau ends up being a third person shooter with strategic elements tacted on. playing on the lower levels, there was zero motivation to even utilize these strategic options. there are a couple side quests at the hub and some very light rpg elements, further muddling what this game is. i'm forced to ask who this game is made for. it does everything. a fan of just about every genre could be it up and say, 'this is.. okay?' this is a simple case of trying to please everyone resulting in inability shine any one area to an acceptable quality. like i said, it is niether bad nor good. but is that really worth your time?",0

good game with a friendly community. devs are intrested in what the players want. you can play this game without spending money on it but if you do spend a few bucks then it just makes the game better for you. if you decide you never want to put money into this game then no fear! you can trade items in-game for premium currency! starting at mastery rank tenno,1

"play tera, blade and soul, and the elder scrolls online instead. the ground battle in rider of icarus is clunky, and this game would be much worse than those games i mentioned above if it didn't have flight battle. the graphics felt like 's. ui is not attracting. and this game doesn't recognize mouse thumb button. for christ's sake, which popular mmorpg game doesn't recognize mouse thumb button nowadays? if i could use mouse thumb button i would have skills abilities spells which didn't have to be activated by pressing my keyboard, and i would have more keys reserved for core skills. after all, this game is not garbage totally, but it's not a gem either. edit my playtime shows that i have played this game for only . hour, but actually i have played this game on the standalone nexon version for over hours. edit let me make this clear you won't get a fancy game as what the fancy introduction video shows you. it's a free-to-play game, so you can give it a try and see it for yourselves.",0

"this is not your normal x or rts game. it can be very hard. the problem is the way the ai enemy behaves or reacts to your success. a normal person used to normal games of that type will be inclined to conquer as many planetary systems as possible. but the way the game is designed, this only makes the ai send larger and larger waves of atackers. and since there is a cap to the number of units you can have, you are quickly overwhelmed. its so frustrating to be punished for success. so since its not a bug but a deliberate design choice, stay away if you dont like games like that. i like to steamroll and overwhelm my enemy but its not possible in this game. you have to be lean and mean, and i'm not fond of that tactic",0

"i don't mind permanent unlocks in my rogue-like, but this isn't how you do it. in traditional 'proper' rogue-likes you could win the game on your first attempt, but you won't, because you lack the knowledge required that comes from your previous attempts. in shattered planet you could never win on your first attempt, because you need to unlock permanent stat upgrades that are acquired by playing, collecting a few resources to buy upgrades, and then dying and starting over again. this fundamentally breaks a large part of what makes rogue-like games compelling, your skill and knowledge counts for nothing against the need to grind. the graphics are quite nice, and i like the idea of being perpetually pushed forward by the encroaching corruption, but the mechanics ruin it. maybe you can reach a point where you have capped the stats, and then it's just your wits vs the game, but i'm not prepared to grind it out to find out. see also vinraith's steam review .",0

"merge assasins creed with batman arkham, then refactor it to lotr, and you'll bake yourself the shadow of mordor. although graphics, world design are solid, the plot seems to be hardly interesting and the gameplay is boring and repetitive. each change that player makes to the game world, virtually doesn't mean anything. rng mechanisms will fill the empty spot minutes after player leaves the area. combat system, whether you'll like it or not, is just a rip-off from batman arkham. it's basically running around mordor killing same boring and unchallenging enemies over and over. it's pretty cheap on rd party stores, however i'm not even sure is it worth the time to finish it, as it's going to be a really long-run.",0
"this game completely took me by surprise. i bought it a while ago and started it and had fun but then forgot about it.i recently began playing it and i highly recommend it. easily one of the most graphically impressive games, it borrows a bit from uncharted but definitely does it better. while the actual 'tomb raiding' takes a backseat, gameplay is absolutely satisyfing as you explore an open world island and fight your way through a crazed cult to find your shipwrecked crewmates. the voice acting is great, lara's voice actress specifically standing out. the scope here is cinematic, with huge set pieces that never detract or take away from interactivity. there are tombs to raid but not nearly as grand or comparable to the original games. there are many collectiables to be found in the form of manuscripts, letters, treasures artifacts, etc. with a robust skill and weapon upgrading system don't try to make sense of how decades old weapons suddenly become new iterations, just enjoy! , combat always packs a satisfying punch. quicktime events can be a little wonky at times, maybe it's just me, out of",1
very fun physics based game. i like this type of comedy and enjoy the bread simulation mechanics. truly original and very challenging!,1
"i'm definitely a fan of the point-and-click adventure, so in that way this may be a tad biased, but i certainly enjoyed this game. a good plot as long as you don't overthink it! with some puzzles that get you thinking, but not enough to bring you out in a cold sweat for the most part. it seems that some of the harder problems can be dodged so that you can continue if things just get too much at those points..but where's the fun in that? - i've played gemini rue from wadjet eye as well, and though the story genre and mood are quite different, this is of a similar quality in my opinion..maybe a little better.",1

"i enjoyed the earlier pixel puzzles games, and looked forward to this one. i found the earlier games fun and relaxing in no zombie mode, at least . this one is mostly aggravating. i do love the fact that your puzzle progress is saved. i'm neutral on the addition of rotation. it does add a challenge and is fine for the pictures where you can make a reasonable guess about the orientation. i don't like the dimming of the floating pieces. you only see the actual colors after you pick up a piece. and i could do without the picture of a hawk killing a seabird. but what really ruins the game for me is the table you build the puzzle on. it is so strongly patterned and colored that it's very hard to see the shapes of the puzzle pieces against it. you can change the color of the table, which doesn't help enough. it would be best if you could switch to a solid color background.",0
look how much time i spent on this game. it costs . just buy it. that is all.,1
"this is a promising new idle game with a lot more strtaegy and unique objectives than the competition. the downside is that progress can slow down a lot after a while since some planned features seem to be missing, it's a bit too reliant on rng, and it eats up a lot more memory than it probably should, but hopefully those issues will get ironed out over time.",1
"dear ubisoft and ivory tower -i bought the game. -after a while i bought wild run dlc - gt i really enjoyed wild run for a while. would have recommended the game -then the calling all units dlc came out - gt now the wild run expansion is locked behind the calling all units dlc - gt i have to buy another dlc just to be able to play what i already bought.. seriously ivory tower ubisoft? instead of discounting the calling all units dlc for the people who already have the wild run dlc you chose to give the wild run dlc away for free to everyone who only buys the calling all units dlc. i'm speechless. i'll never ever buy anything published by ubisoft unless this mess gets fixed. sincerely, a lost customer of yours",0
"worst zombie game i've ever played- and i can't even count how many i've played. the controls suck, fighting is ridiculous, and no real tutorial. it's ok when a zombie game is hard but not when the gameplay isn't even realistic. i was shooting zombies in the head and i had to hit like times, as if i were shooting at any other part of the body. here i thought shooting any being in the head universally meant they would die faster, not at the same rate as if hitting the chest. i would never, ever recommend this game. i'm also shocked it had good ratings.",0
"this is a great little game that will keep you going back for more, its addictive gameplay, although i could only play a few levels before my head was hurting. it seems there is not much of a multiplayer population for this game. which is a big lettdown for me, as there is only computer left to play.",1
pc version doesn't work. don't buy until patched.,0
"alot of fun but very mixed up when it comes to building a player you want from weapon to certain powers, its all a mess. many players argue like children when you ask certain questions about the game, plus half of them speak only spanish. you have to buy your way through the game which basically takes away the fun. currencies are limited, powers, player bases. checking out the furniture was a disappointment, there were no normal beds or any pieces you'd place in a player base, just junk. the economy through the 'broker' is expensive and rediculous. people are not friendly or helpful, server maintenance lasts hours every or days in between.",0
great game.if u liked blood money there is a chance u will like this game.,1
one of the most fun multiplayer games ever. its fun robbing banks with friends. i recommend this game to all you player out there!! must have colection,1

"i use to play this game back when the cap lvl was and then -. i'm honestly dissapointed in the expanisons after rise of isengard. some of the new areas will bring you dow to like fps. mounted combat is dreadful. 'epic' battles are not epic. pvmp is so broken. wardens, weavers, most classes can solo a keep. population is dying which is why servers were shut down. honestly, it's sad to see it crumble. as soon as it was bought out by wb. it was gonna go down. and alot of people at turbine lost their jobs because of that deal. i still will play it with the nostalgia tho, and all the fun times i had with my friends. who now have departed for valinor. leaving me in middle-earth to continue the struggle against the forces of darkness!",0
bought it when it first came out. been playing ever since. will probably play it forever. one of the best.,1
simply beautiful. insurgency is by far the best fps i've every played. best thing is it's realistically team-based you can't run around no-scoping hostiles with your over powered kbar sniper rifle grenade launcher. the only thing i'd critique them on is that they dont have a truly solo game mode. i highly recommend you get it.,1
"amazing timekiller. no point tho. just click til things die. easy to get addicted. i just quit after level , since after level the level designs restart from level . killed lots of time with this, but now im quitting.",0

can't sign in with steam anymore,0
this is a great game! it has a unique combat style and is a way to keep challenging yourself with the same kind of gameplay as the actual storyline versions of this game.,1

picked it up on sale. so worth it!,1
"as much as i like the scenario and anticipated this game i really liked stranded , i can't help but be disappointed. it's not necessarily even the length, which i don't mind at that pricepoint, but it's that for a narrative-driven game, the story goes nowhere. it feels more like the prologue to a story than one in itself.",0
very good game. a must buy.,1
it looked fun but it's unplayable. i can run much better games but i can't run this one for some reason and the sad part is that in a rush i accidentally left it running and now i cant refund it.,0
"i love mortal kombat, its my favourite fighting game. the game has many improvments than the previous ones, the variations is a great concept makes it easier to focus on certain abilities and fighting styles, i'm upset that i can't get the kombat pack on pc, tottaly unfair, but what can i do, it's corprate greed. anyway, its a great game definetly recomended",1
"im going to have to say no.. dont get it, because i been playing this game for atleast a month or and now i cant even log in.. i mean wtf? many many many many hours of hard work.. and then its gone just like that.. - you have to wait hours on somethings and its not a good enough game to waste your time on. -and the cool down time in battles is just to long, i can see if it was only s cooldown time but its not. -getting your account deleted or what ever is comlpete b.s. -enough said..",0
"yes, i know that the description says you can't play online. well, acutally, you can. gameranger allows you to play most of the old gamespy games that no longer have online capabilities. however, i will say that gameranger doesn't have the best connection. but i still have a blast with my friends even with occasional lag. also, this game is much better than any fps or tps. best shooter out of",1
"i don't understand how this game has such good reviews. the trailer really makes the game seem more fun than it actually is. the monsters animation quality and the map design are pretty bad on top of the very little you can do in the game. the cameras seem more useful in a multiplayer situation and the status of mulitplayer is alpha. pros -the core gameplay has good ideas, only executed poorly cons -numerous lighting bugs and missing textures -poor sound effect normalization -triggered events are the scariest part of the entire game -no way to turn off mouse acceleration -multiplayer is barely working -seems like development has died",0
"pritty poor performance for the visual quality, and frequent crashing. leave it for now till they fix it. along with that i hear they are chopping the story short so you buy the dlc to finish it. honestly wish i had bought the key from steam rather than gamesplanet so i could get a refund and wait for months down the line when i can get the lot for the price of a game and its patched and optimised. guess i got done. very dissapointed as i loved human revolution.",0

"annoying voice overs 'we have been enslaved by the zombies' 'the zombies will return' over and over and over and over, same repetitive gameplay , pay to win, barely cs at all. it's way too..adulterated to be considered a counter strike game. i felt dirty playing this game, and i still feel dirty now that i uninstalled it.",0
"gemini rue is a point-and-click game, with a furturistic-noir feel to it. the dark and mysterious atmosphere created by the extremely good soundtrack, gorgeous visuals and outstanding voice acting create a world that immerses you on such a high level you forget you are sitting in front of a computer. just because this is a point-and-click game, does not mean that it's a game for kids or noobs. there are gunfights, which are both intense and challenging to play as ammo is limited and you can only take shots. lack of quick-thinking will lead to death. the plot line is in no way cliche, it is paced out extremely well and characters are interesting, accompanied by the excellent voice acting. the hints and information build up on a very solid story, and the plot twist is unpredictable, punchy, and shocking - the elements of a perfect plot twist. as you travel through this hour game as azriel odin, trying to find his lost brother or delta- trying to escape. dark, immersive out of goty",1
"all i can say is this game is insane fun. got it over the christmas period, and while the 'story' is roughly hours, i have logged hours on this game and have had a blast every minute! actually went ahead and did completion cos it was so much fun doing it. very cool superpowers, awesome weapons, customizable character. cannot recommend this game enough if you wanna have fun",1
best character creation screen of all time.,1
probably the most fun i've had in a game for a while now.,1
"so.. the procedural algorithm used in no man's sky pretty much sucks all of the planets are mostly the same. same terrain, same plants, same rocks, same cave systems. only the atmospheres and animals vary. what's even worse is that exploring all of these similar planets makes up about of the game. ships, combat, space stations, aliens, customizing your stuff, and getting to the center of the galaxy all seem like nothing more than an afterthought, all lumped into that last . the game is really fun, for about a week if that . after that, it's just a grind. a grind which, as far as i can tell, has no reward worthy of the time required for it.",0
"couldnt play it for more than minutes. poor grafic poor jogability bought it at bucks, not all sad",0
challenging and beautifully put together,1
"toxic community and dull, lifeless gameplay. waste of time and money.",0
"i'm going to go against the grain here and say this is not a game that you should be spending on. it is the exact same thing over and over again, from the very first mission to the very last. this game is a repetitive stress injury waiting to happen with all of the constant clicking to attack and spinning your mouse if you don't choose to use a controller . bland and boring enemies that really present no challenge other than there being so many of them or, in the case of the gutter rat, being able to get the surprise on you. there isn't currently any subscription or dlc or in-app purchases, so i'm not sure how they expect to properly monetize this so they can provide the numerous updates and additions that it needs. i'm sure there will be plenty of dc sooner or later, but until then, you get heroes and or so levels to replay hundreds of times.",0

"finished the game to completion, although it was a close thing. game has lots and lots of bugs, and crashed several times even requiring a hard shutdown of my computer . it's very annoying to have to redo levels several times. this game involves a lot time wasting actions to make the game longer. it does follow the movie quite well, but without talking the scenes can acctually be pretty annoying they make odd grunting sounds . once you're in, you feel the need to complete it, but it might be tough with the crashes and boring redo requirments. pros follows movie cheap on sale cons crashes time wasting actions no voice acting",0

"this is a game that similar to minecraft starts you out with nothing, given the task to survive and mine. however, as you stumble upon more and more things your island has to offer, you discover how this game never ceases to amaze. i could play this game daily and still be in awe of the many things one can do and accomplish. i keep getting surprised by this game myself! i highly reccommend this game, and i believe that this game will only keep growing.",1

"ok first omg this game is amazing. both the gameplay and the looks. its story is just filled withe your favorite fantasy films books. like you can just ride around in the game and jusy enjoy the landscape. so is this game worth it? yes becuse the story is amazing, the action is out of and this game is so much more then what is seems. in my opinion its a must buy.",1
my brother teased me for playing this game then i challenged him to play it and laughed at him when he got frustrated. best cooking game ever!,1
lost of bugs. crashes a lot and if you cant get it going soon its a bit complicated and will take you a minute to figure it out you end up playing 'past your refund time played'. i spent hours trying to research maps i can actually play. thanks steam.,0
"a truly legendary game, i wish they would keep going on it, i hear . is the final update. the only bad thing i can say about it is that i can't seem to play any other d sandbox side scrollers lol! i tried a few and they just do not compare to this game, starbound tried, but it failed, i will always love this game, i have over hours on the game, didn't have internet for a long period of time so all my hours are offline, if you want to play a great game that will keep you hooked for hundreds of hours, then i highly recommend terraria!!",1

"sick game i reccomend it to all my friends, this game was my first ever steam game so its sick",1
"the singleplayer campaign for this game is literally just a spam of grenades. on the hardest difficulty setting, you can have as many as three active grenade-warning-indicators at your location at a single time infinite enemy respawn. no other call of duty that i've played has had so many grenades being chucked at you. the only way to complete levels on this difficulty is to just rush through. the sniper boss fight segment is almost impossible to do on the hardest difficulty as well and makes no logistical sense the enemy sniper does not obey the laws of physics or any constraints of the human body in how fast he can get from window to window to ruin your day",0

"'blech, gnats ' - rufus i got deponia in a bundle including other games, so i got my moneys worth out of it. that said, isn't a lot to throw away. deponia is not worth . it's a short, shallow post-apocalyptic world with no real attempt at world building which is sad as the espresso machine showed that it could have had potential , with an unlikable main character being by design doesn't make it any better , puzzles that require out of game knowledge not everyone has heard of phosphorescence , and a pretentious end of act cutscenes that aren't adding anything to the narrative. since they've been compared to lucasarts in the description, i feel i should say that this wouldn't even be act of a monkey island game. rufus is the perfect mascot for this franchise - a self centered egotist who thinks they're a lot cleverer than they are.",0
i love gta and everything about the series. the game was fun played on xbox but i can not get it to work on pc. i bought the game with a gta bundle package. i would love to be able to play on pc for the mods. i give the game a solid thumbs up but for now until the issue is resolved it will be a thumbs down.,0

"i purchased this game mainly for the zombies and the single player career mode as there are too many cheats in multiplayer. the servers take too long to connect you to a map. when you eventually do get connected and start playing, there seems to be a problem in keeping whoever hosts the game as host and will pause for minutes as it finds another host. all weapons seem to be a bit on the poo side in comparison to previous cod titles all activision made cod titles seem to suffer in the same way. steer clear of activision cod's i playerd for minutes and only owned it for days and under the steam agreement where if a game is less than days old and less than hours played, steam will refund .. as long as the title was purchased through steam, obviously! doh!! the game sucks and the servers are much too slow to play a fast paced game such as this. my advice is not to buy the activision cod's and wait for infinity ward treyarch titles that are far more playable than any activision made cod's.",0

"the game is hard to recommend in it's current state. it feels very empty and unfinished, there's very little to do. every map is the same as the last and apart from the very simplistic combat and generic go-there, or kill-that missions there is nothing to do. this game is obviously designed for a phone or tablet as the ui sucks. where are my faction levels? what ship type do i own? you'll find yourself asking a lot of questions like these, because there is no ui to give you that information. in all honesty you are far better off playing sid meier's pirates.",0

"telltale games, o my god, thank you for your games released and for cooperation with other companies, creating new games in other universes. tales from the borderlands is a perfect spin-off, created in a humorous way with blood, intestines and loader boats. if other games of telltale games were too serious for you like they were for me , this game will satisfy you fully. waiting for new episodes patiently.",1
"this is the best alien game to date. probably the only one worth owning. it's survival horror with more of a focus on patience, stealth, and staying out of the way which can be very frustrating at times. the atmosphere, graphics and sound are all incredible. i couldn't stop thinking about this game when i wasn't playing it. if you love the first alien movie, or you really like survival horror games, pick this one up.",1

"nope! pushing down w while someone talks about how profound everything that's going on is, well it has its limits. for example, the lack of profound things going on is a limiting factor. the lack of anything interesting happening, or any choices occuring is another. deeply dull in a profound way, both in its broken design, and its overbearing narration.",0
"a pretty decent way to share how the game was created and developed over the years, great job!",1
"devs abandoned, came back, added paid dlc and left again. this dlc is unbalanced and they make it very apparent in game that you re missing the dlc. truely, it was a fun fps with building elements but the devs just didn't properly support it.",0

"a pretty solid shooter, but the story just gets in the way.",1
"the ending maybe a meh i don't like how they end it ..but i think the overall gameplay is fun, if you like fantasy tbs game i think you will like this one and that is why i recommend this game.",1
"best story, best not to cry ' out of for this game",1
"i wish the game would let me play it, but it told me i wasnt allowed.",0
"i would not suggest ever buying this game, it is not good in anyway and is a waste of money and it needs to be changed",0
"awful controls, so difficult to actually dodge the direction you want without using the dumb 'focus on enemy' thing, you'd love this game though if you're a dumb console gamer.. if you downvote you're obviously a fanboy that is butthurt because i stated somkething true that is bad about the game.",0
out of would lick this banana again,1
"it's got the right moves in fact it owes a lot to crimsonland, the predecessor of this game, which made top-down massacres fun , but then it does some things wrong, like adopt the 'edgy' modern military aesthetic complete with the ing awful color palette, motion blur, and the lack of gameplay challenge. there is difficulty, but only because the zombies with guns provide an incredible difficulty spike. perks feel boring. the endless slaughter gets boring. boring boring boring boring. the developer occasionally updates this with free dlc and refined mechanics, so maybe in a couple of years this will be a good game.",0
"very very very nice platformer with some nice puzzles and gorgeous graphics. not hard at all, but very satisfying. this game is so underrated it's one of the best platformers i played in some years.",1

revolver-reloading simulator fistful of frags is a shooter made with the source engine it's set in the wild west times which is seen pretty rarely in fps-games this setting leads to long reloading times. really long reloading times dual walker so you have to play in a very different way than in cod or cs go for example you can also kick people away from you and that's awesome. the only downside of fistful of frags in my opinion are the melee weapons. seriously. this hatchet overall it's a good f p game and i can really recommend it to every wild west fan out of would get hit by an axe while reloading for hours again,1

"new and exciting at first. felt like playing final fantasy and a shooter at the same time. to come and realize, the content never changes. was like playing an iphone game which had limited functionality. even acquiring the frames were purposefully made tedious, to later not need them for anything outside of boredom. the platinum system is joke, play draco for a few days and make a few thousand p. the ceiling for this game is too low. even the raids became just another place to farm and sell for plat, to later use the plat to just expedite research items that are strictly used for a checlist of completed items. this game could have so much more, i feel bad for those who spent hundreds of dollars for some in-game 'founder' badge.",0
"the single player story is weak and uninsprring and locked into an imperium only view. but i didn't purchase the game for the single player experience, i wanted multiplayer ship battles against my friends and new foes on the internet. after paying my i'm not allowed to have a multiplayer experience. there is no way to play against your friends. the best you can do is team up and get half the usual points and ships just to fight two random opponents on the internet. you cannot jump in and play this game in multiplayer. you are forced to grind for hours to unlock all the content and ships for each race. that will be hours of grinding to unlock all the races. if you want to fight the ai you are still forced to grind again for each race, and again for each difficulty level. when the developers were questioned about this they affirmed there is no intention to allow you to play multiplayer without being forcing grinding to unlock the content that you've paid for.",0
"uplay, the tutorial and console gameplaying crap the ing quick time events and and the checkpoint system really sux! f.u. ubi !",0
got to say this is one of my favourite games ever. all the detail and love poured into this game from cdpr is astounding. this is like previous witchers combined with open world and god-tier dialogue and choices. i feel a bit sad after the long and difficult journey with geralt through the books and games and now it's finally over. thank you cdpr.,1
not a good buy in my opinion. if you want a supreme commander game get the first one or forged alliance.,0
"it's a very fun and easy to play game, however it's quite simple, there aren't even video settings in it. just pick up and play. would be really cool on a surface or something of that nature. don't expect civ in space, it's not even going to come close to that. it's a very short casual game. no tutorial really, just tooltips, but with those it takes around minutes to figure the game out so it's not really a bad thing. the game definitely could've gone further, but for the price on the winter sale of about cad it's definitely a great purchase. i intend on playing this on my macbook when i need something to just pass a few minutes.",1
i honestly don't understand the fandom for this game. this game doesn't look that great. this game has a massive and empty world which gets boring quickly. this game's combat system is shallow and overhyped. personal opinion out of,0
"this game is all about grinding. its fun, it is done great and its addicting. and.. its free. so if grinding is your thing just give it a try. i have played this game for a few months now and i had a great time and just a tip from me, the whole new space system and moon are broken, dont play them until they will balance it out and fix it, dont waste your time as for .. .",1

"binding of isaac is a fun procedurally generated legend of zelda clone where you play as a baby named isaac who is being chased by his insane mother, who was told by god to kill him. the combat system is beautiful in its simplicity, and the enemies are diverse and difficult enough to make any sane person rage. definitely one of my favorite indie games out there.",1
"so i got this game as a comical game for my youtube channel, i start playing it im like wow the story is actually okay, the dating sim aspect is really cool to implement with the candy crush-like feature. its really fun well detailed and all around a really fun and thrilling game",1
"do you like alien ninjas with laser weapons? then this might be the title for you. addictive and fun gameplay had me hooked and i put hours in over the first weeks. big ups to the devs for not making this pay to win as well, everything in game can be accuired through playing. this game is free to play, so there is no harm in trying even if it doesnt seem like your thing",1
"so simple yet so fun, this one is hard to put down.",1
"this is a poor excuse of a game, long loading times, choppy framerate, even on the lowest possible graphics, confusing keyboard and mouse layout, and grammar errors- seriously 'choide'?? even though is recently released, not even pre-alpha state can redeem this trite. this game isn't even worth , and it has two advertisements.

"funny. for the first minutes. then you run out of things to do. if you really want to see what the 'hype' is about, get it on sale when it's only a few dollars, don't spend the unreasonable . that they're asking for it. great for a quick laugh, but again, gets old after a while.",0
i can't even describe how awesome this game is!,1
personally i dont think its a bad game but i do understand why people give it negative reveiws. i think it is a decent fps for the price and reminds you of some of the old school games. people seem to forget this is an old game.,1
great game for those true gamers who appreciate a challenging game.,1

when this game came out my friend got it. i didnt see him for a while much after cause he was playing this the whole time. he was so excited about it he bought it for me on steam. i had no interest in this game. no care what so ever for it. how i was wrong. this game is brilliant. its so much fun. so engrossing. and just generally awesome. no regrets.,1

"this game is just wacky. brilliant way to impement loadouts with out applying overpowered weaponry. fully customisable rifles which can be changed into a shotgun or blunderbus to a assult rifle back to a smg or a heavy sniper rifle. and if that wasn't cool enough go around headshotting your team with the heal payload. just insane. graphicly speaking isn't revolutionary, but how ever very well made and placed. very cartoony but not crappy. loving the fact that i can have my head blown off but carry on with a floating brain with eyes not giving a single care in the world. gamemodes are brilliantly comedic instead of ctf its capture the hammer, oh did i mention that the hammer you can smash your foes with? not only that it adds to your teams score when you capture it. serously the damn game if free. it ain't gonna harm you and you will get boundless joys out of it.",1

hardly anybody plays this game. it would've been awesome,0
this was an enjoyable game until my mac updated to mountain lion. it just crashes now. can't play it at all. i can recommend the game for windows but since telltale is just ignoring a problem i can't recommend the game for mac users.,0
"broken game with too many gameplay bugs. while patch . fixes a few, there are still many issues that need to be fixed. the last federation scores points for trying to put a different spin on the x strategy genre but the execution has been pretty craptastic. this game was rushed out the door with serious issues such as ai not initiating ground combat, numerous typos like 'peacekeeers', missing diplomacy options boarines have no option to join the federation even with a solar unity regent , broken special weapons, but i'll just leave it at that. a lot of this game just dosen't work, or has been band-aided to kinda work. still considering buying it? i suggest waiting until they release about a years worth of patches before jumping in or wait until it's on sale for .. otherwise welcome to paid beta. this game takes 'indie game sloppy' to the next level. i like the concept, but the implementation and execution is horrid.",0

"requires a game controller, and you'll be holding both triggers down most of the time. let go of a trigger early to watch one of the sons drop to his death. pretty much no reason not to hold down the triggers all the time and only let go on the rare occasion that's relevant, until you realize this game is just finger torture even with the most comfortable of game controllers, which mine is definitely not. the game seemed pretty good at first, but even the beautiful scenery was quickly overwhelmed by my aching fingers. maybe my hands are just too old for this game.. but to me that speaks poorly of the game. i hear it has a sad ending, but sadly i'll never get there.",0
"brilliant puzzle game and concept. however, the control issue is plaguing the game as of today, aug , . i play with a ps joystick using input mapper. right shoulder is supposed to rotate the bricks, but somehow the game also speeds up the mouse walking rate. this is very frustrating. i really hope that the author would fix this issue. i think once the control issue is gone, i could definitely recommend this game.",0
it just makes -d games that yr olds would play sorry but out of,0
"despite the beautiful graphics, the combat can be unforgiving.. no, rather, unbalanced. one example would be chapter where the boss attacks with a nonstop spin attack that almost immediately kills your whole party. you will die from it because you cant block it for long enough. other than that the menus should be easier to navigate and usable roads clearly visible instead of having invisible walls. a lot of minor things make it mediocre. can't recommend.",0
not a bad game even if it could have be pulled out better. i enjoyed the story and to a certainextent the gameplay but che checkpoint system and the low error tolerance makes you play some sections various times and that can become unpleasant.,1
terrible. just god awful. can't even play past the first minutes without getting fps lag or some weird glitch. uplay.,0
"this game is excellent. beautiful music, fantastically simple graphics, and addicting gameplay. super difficult, especially in the higher levels. the location specific challenges and trains really enhance the experience and make the maps really feel different from each other. all around a great game.",1

"'this game is amazing' is an understatement. this game exeeded all my expectations by a long shot, it's story is a bit short, but nonetheless is amazing, soundtrack is one of the best ones i have heard in a long while, original gameplay. if you read this and say 'hmm i don't know if i sould get this', do it. you will like it if you like story driven and story rich games, now go fourth! and buy this game! out of",1
the controls for combat are a pain to use and i was just bored as hell while playing.,0
"'close but no cigar' best decribes this title. wwi is 'virgin ground' and therefore has lots of potential as it was the dawn of a new kind of warfare. however, in thier quest for 'historical accuracy' which i can respect the developers of verdun have sacrificed everything else. - graphics are 'meh' at best. - weapon deadzones and enemy hitboxes are all over the place. - forced pvp if you want to level or keep any xp . - non-existant playerbase. - only pve gamemode and you cant even win! it's like cod zombies w out the zombies. you and three others hold a location as long as you can against successive waves of enemies until you die thats it. if you want a ww experience that is even remotely feels fun or rewarding play bf , though that has it's own failings.",0
really fun to play. easy to get into. love how it spoofs itself and the whole jrpg genre with it's jokes. definitely recommend it.,1
"don't let the hours posted fool you, over the last years i have about , hours into this game on several systems, one of the few games that i would surely buy again, and will most likely at some point, buy again. not only does it have a great story but it's also got almost as many first of it's kind as the original playstation on which it came out. while maybe not graphically on par with the things of this age, the entire experience is one that has been unmatched since, many good games have come and gone, played and forgotten, but this has had such a following that the company that made it, finally did something they said wouldn't happen until another game beat it in sales and following, them remaking it, i will play this and hopefully the next happily for years to come. will you?",1

"this title surprised me immensely. it's a tribute to truly effective psychological horror. the story was well written, immersive, and did a fantastic job of setting up a foreboding atmosphere. gameplay consists of just a few simple puzzles. you're not required to solve all of them to move forward, but i would recommend not skipping any if you want the full experience. the ending is not something that can easily be described. it's something that could definitely cause a distinct chill down the back of your neck. if you like suspense, this game will probably do it for you. xd",1
bad need aleast gigs of ram very laggy if you even have ! dont get it!!,0
this game sucks!! the graphics suck. the controls suck. everything sucks. do not buy this game!!,0
this is a rip off version of agario and it is not a good one. the skins are terrible looking. gameplay is really laggy no matter what server you are in. i have to give it a out of . if your gonna make a clone of agario atleast make it decantly good and know that this isnt even mitosis thats going on.,0
"very good game, so much fun but also so hard and takes some time to get used to it. the combat in it is so realistic, epic and intense, i usually get chills when i get in combat. shouldnt waste bullet in some modes.. or even shoot randomly at noone, just to hear your weapon sound, believe me, thats a bad idea.. lots of community made mods which are tons of fun, makes the game way better. great when played with friends as a team, you can put a plan and stick to it, its also very fun to use military commands such as in real life. one of my favorite games!",1
menus and interfaces are messy as and it seems like the developers spent most of their time on the town bit of the game. creating a lobby was also confusing. many of the courses seem like they were rushed and no thought were put into them. i would give the game itself out of,0
"the lack of races make it not as good as bb chaos edition. the new animations are awesome and everything looks great but it lacks the variety that bb has and as such i find myself going back and playing that. when more races are out, definitely will recommend.",0

"i've just completed this game and i can't recommend it at all. this abomination of a game disguises itself with the day of the tentacle graphics, but is really an exercise in frustration. the basis of this game, the physics engine, is highly unreliable. nearly every advanced procedure becomes a gamble. the checkpoint which is a bad system to start with saves neither your level time nor your dimension change count. this means every level up to five minutes with required changes and really tough time challenges has to be done in one go to get the achievements. you'll waste a insane amount of time. one of the worst 'gaming' experiences of my life. do not buy this game. p.s. believe it or not. the dlc's are even worse. you'll just want to punch the devs in the face, really really hard..",0
"the system requirements are total lies. unless you have a gb , you will get fps. bad match making due to low population because they decided to release this game during overwatch beta. single player is maps, with difficulties and frankly they are a snooze to breeze through. you will get bored the nd time through. i expected a lot more from gearbox. i hope they fix it, because it really feels like they rushed this out the door. really sad, i wanted to like this game.",0
"played this when i was younger, but it died a long time ago.",0
s game. don't buy it.,0
fun game. had me hooked for a good hours. got it on special for bucks. great deal!,1
"the controls are wonky, the game does a very bad job of informing you whats importiant and what the guns go in which slots and what you currently have equiped. in most missions rather you or the enemies are unkillable juggernauts, its also annoying that you can do some bounties before you get the bounty and when you do get the bounty there is nobody there to kill so you just wasted credits for usless information. its also crappy to have a ship combat game were you are bound to an axis and cannot dogfight while the enemies can fly around you shooting you. the ai for your guns should also be better, it makes sense that if of your turrets can auto fire than all of the turrests should be able to auto fire. the game does do a very good job with its music and thematic choices but there is no point in dragging yourself through the lame combat to explore the world.",0
game. dont even try it.,0
"story out of gameplay out of graphics out of music out of fun factor out of total , out of not as good as the first part. you're basically just a lonely big daddy from the beginning till the end. story's kinda lame at some parts. would recommend it only to the real big daddies out there.",0

by far the worst golf game i have ever played,0
"i've played every single ac game since the first, and this one is definitely the best since ac i'm not sure if anything can beat ac . the world is massive, there are various cities and towns dotted across the map rather than just a few big ones ..and these cities towns are still pretty big and cool to run around in. the real eye-candy are the islands that are literally everywhere on the world map. even the small, miniscule islands are absolutely gorgeous and are worth exploring. the water, the weather, the day night cycles, everything graphical in this is just amazing to look at. and the main character is finally likable in an ac game again. connor in ac was just annoying to me, so ezio was the last really likable character in the series. edward is a bit of an anti-hero, but that's what makes him likable. not only is the acting done really well, but he has no issues with doing what he pleases for whatever he wants..as you would expect a pirate to be like. so yes, great title and very worth the buy",1
"hey guys, remember we said we were offering free stuff for crimefest? lol we lied you get microtransactions instead you pieces of . never expect anything nice from us again. in all seriousness, a brief reason why microtransactions here are unjustifiable and why this deserves boycottting -several previous statements saying they wouldn't put microtransactions in -stat boosting skins which will give a gun an edge over someone elses gun -apparently, most guns have been nerfed in such a way that you need the stat boosts to get them up again -some guns have been massively buffed -crimefest said the community would get free stuff -the safes you get take up a card drop. so instead of ingame money, or masks, or colors, or textures, or the stuff that people actually want from a card drop, you can get something you have to pay money to use. in a game with around worth of dlc yourselves on a ing nuke overkill",0
it's bad don't buy it,0

"terrible texturing, the atmosphere was decent. i didn't like the story telling either, it was just poorly told, a lot of hamfisted things, not stretched out long enough etc. no real action either, basically a walking simulator with a poorly written story of some guy doing horrible things to a defenseless little girl. i think david could have put a much better effort into this and polished things up a bit. i played twice to see if i missed anything, nope.",0
"imagine a number, ask your friend to guess it. tell him that he is wrong even if he is right. kill him with one hit. sounds like fun? even screenshots shows level available at max. because tortuga kill with hit!",0

"true black operation! operate the game, and freeze in black.",0
"this is game is amazing. the story is kind of weird, but in that crazy cool sort of way. it really makes you think. when you are playing the game you actually feel like you are in columbia due to the amazing immerisive attention to detail. the gameplay is also fantastic. it's so much fun to jump off of a skyrail into a hoard of enemies. i highly recomend this game.",1
"it will take you arround hours to build all the buildings and unlock out of playable areas -after hours there is nothing left to do, you just login to collect the resources and in order to unlock the th area you either have to keep collecting resources till the end of your life , fight with the same units for battles or give money -battles feel the same after you unlocked all the units it will take you arround hours of gameplay to unlock all the units -pvp keeps disconnecting me when you disconnect ai takes controll of your units and there is no way of joining the battle again -strategy is for year old kids all you can do is switch units positions,pay money for extra melee dmg or tap on the screen for better charge attacks its free you can play from your phone uninstalls fast my dog liked it out of i dont even know why its a total war game.",0
"huge world, i know of invisible walls, but normal play has never taken me to one. i've had a lot of fun with both the base game and the dlc. sometimes story items are inconviniently far away from my location, but i suppose the zombie apocolipse wouldn't exactly be the most convinient thing overall. big modding community, lots of great mods. the lady who gives you missions is naggy and talks to you about every little thing, i added a mod that made her shut up. out of - would buy on sale again.",1

"just started playing this game acouple days ago, and i cant stop. i love it. i diddent play the first yet but i am going to now that number is this good. the combat is really fun, sometimes hard but overall really good.",1
there are only a few songs you can sing and devs are not adding anything new..,0
"the story is great and all but act feels really rushed. like how vella's family is suddenly friends with those cloud people she randomly met when shay visits the cloud. when did they even get there? how did they get so close? why did the developers recycle the same characters and scenery? and once you finish act one the puzzles are just impossible to figure out. even the solutions make very little sense when you find them in a guide. i only checked the community guides once or twice for act but i need to constantly tab out to them for act , which i've only finished half of so far because it gets so frustrating all the time. it could have been done so much better but they rushed it instead. ugh. so anyway, i would only reccomend this if you're buying it on sale and don't mind having to check a guide every now and then. if you enjoyed other double fine games like stacking then you'll love act one because the puzzle difficulty is about the same. otherwise nope.",1
"a perfect example of steams lack of quality control, the game is not worth your money. even if they would give it out for free the time you waste playing this is worth more than the game itself. poor mac port, boring gameplay un original idea and no budget project.",0
"you like the movie 'drive'? you will love this! perfectly built, fast-paced, challenging gameplay that keeps you coming back for. has more style flowing through it than you have blood in your body. the soundtrack is ic. do you like hurting other people? after playing this game, the only answer you'll have is yes.",1
do you like goats? are you in the mood for a rediculous sandbox game? then goat simulator is the game for you! this game actually has some very interesting surprises hidden here and there. it actually rewards you for doing stuff. certain achievements give you different skins or abilities found under 'custom game' - 'morphs' and is actually quite fun! i highly recommend this game.,1
"amazing !! this game has everything amazing levels, amazing dlcs, amazing open world even if it is almost the same as in 'lego marvel super heroes' and an amazing collection of playable characters !! 'just shut up and take my money lego'",1

this game is so ing hard and boring,0
was good until all the furries and year olds ruined it. dont buy unless you want to be known as a fox er for the rest of your life,0
"this game feels.. unfinished. you move slowly, there's lots of banter to go through, and the dialogue seems to try and force as many remarks or little jokes into every. single. text block. the dialogue even comes off as if the one writing it was bored. there's minigames you play as well, though you can skip them if you so choose. all i can think is, if it's not an unfinished project, then it must have been a test run for a bigger project. at least i hope so.",0
"one finger death punch is so awesome that for a game with the use of only buttons, it's too much fun that can't be expressed. i'm old school. i grew up an s baby. i watched kung fu movies every weekend, and when the movies ended went outside and played like we knew kung fu with every kid on the block. this is that without the outside, the kids, or the need to get accidentally hit by your friends in the eye. i recommend this game to all who would be willing.",1
"better then it had any right to be, an exceptional shooter with a surprisingly engaging story to tell.",1
there's nothing that makes me more sick than seeing game corporations use modding for their marketing campaign.,0
"lead your arny's and conquer all in your path, and if you die.. die with honor! great game, easily one of my favorite 'total war' games, the interface is easy to understand and use. and watching the battles unfold after you give your orders is truly amazing. 'witch is noting new to total war' but with the graphics update and general upgrade for the orignal enjine total war is back and better than ever.",1
"would be great fun if it wasn't broken. keeps sending me on a fire while in the chiefs car with only an extinguisher that wont go out. might go out with a handline from one of the lf trucks but no way to find out. there's also no way to replace the extinguisher on scene so once you use it all up, that's it. realistic, yes, but not when you dump the entire can on a 'broken' fire. i love this for what it's done correctly, but i can't in good conscience recommend it. if it were bucks i'd say yes and or if the day comes where they fix it i may say yes.",0
it's a florida stand your ground law simulator. out of,1
"don't buy just finished the campaign and it wasn't that great, had to restart the game too, is that a bug? thought the game would be more of a challenge, the only thing i found challenging was getting away from the cops but this was just annoying and not why i bought the game. driving feels terrible especially with mouse and keyboard. the game studders or shakes a little when driving fast for example, it makes it feel laggy. the only way you can challenge a friend is if he is on his phone and you are in the game, but thanks to uplay this will most likely crash before you are done. you can't hack friends as the game walkthrough that ubisoft put up showed. matchmaking with random people usually takes forever and if someone hacks into your game it tends to happen while you are doing something else like hacking a ctos tower or you just finished a mission.. nope you can't hack your firends and that really sucks..",0
the game is cool looking but i cant play cause of the mouse lag,0
"nothing better than f p games. has great potential, really cool that it has large open maps. thats its a huge planet! to close this i would say its for people like that sci-fi weapons and large open maps! stay fazey-basic",1
"really fun game! i go to the gym a few times a week but it was still very challenging, physically and mentally. i kept thinking there has to be an end but seemed like it was going forever, the music and body shaped tunnels still haunt my sleep.. i think a cool feature would be a spectator mode where someone can sit at the keyboard and be one of the gym goers in the background and lob balls at you to put you off, and if perhaps if you hit them away with your hand you get a bonus of some sort. just and idea to give it more replay value. .. and yes, my butt is bloody spectacular",1
game does not work on it's own and instead of just patching or running a script that fixes it you have to completely uninstall 'games for windows' and reinstall the latest version. simlply doing an update will not do.,0
it boggles the mind that this game has mostly positive reviews ..,0
its borderlands . fun but not quite as good as borderlands,1
"out of best game i've played in years. everything is perfect, the music, the story, the gameplay, all top notch. x better than any triple a game out to date. i can't recommend this game enough. if you can, get the goty edition, the dlc is an awesome edition to the game, one could even say its better than the main story.",1
you get to stab people. in rome. while riding a unicorn. that should be enough to sell you on this game.,1
the remake are faithfull to the original version.,1
"when you start playing it at first, it looks kinda like ets , but its better, harder, and more accurate. amazing roads and buildings, almost the hole map is very cool. finally, the speed cameras and the police is a good thing, it makes you angry sometimes tho xd, thanks scs.",1
its enjoyable some people say the graphics are bad and its true but im a sucker for early 's pc graphics and its the definition of a sandbox. no playthrough will be the same ever. the factions wage war on each other independently and the world is still an active one even if you do nothing. but then you can crush the other kingdoms and loot and burn the inocent and crush the world in your palm burning it let everyone know your name as death comes for them in the form of you!! so i'd give it a reccomendation.,1
"this game is a terrible f p clone of call of duty, with completely broken hit detection and an anti-cheat that messes with your regestry and puts a shady .exe in your win folder. dont bother downloading this game, its not even worth the download time.",0
"i played it with friends for a descent amount of time, but after the newest update.. this game became dead for me. not only beacuse the fact that microtransactions give you skins to weapons that change statistics, but also beacuse of the lie that developers said. this made them not worth my trust, time, money. this change made the game unfun.",0
"this is a really fun game. you can play minigames, teamdeath match, all kinds of things. but for the life of me i just cant bunny hop.",1
"the game has a good representation of the different races of the warhammer universe, all the teams are enjoyable to play as and the dice roles are realistic.",1
what the hell is wrong with these sh ty ports? my specs are more than enough for at least medium settings and no matter what this game stutters more than gareth gates on crack. it is pretty much unplayable in this state.,0
"this game makes me sorry i didn't support them when i saw it on kickstarter. the game plays just like, or better, than the table top. i like the turn based combat. my ownly complaint is the lack of control i have over saving. it feels like i should be able to save when i want. instead one must complete a quest and get back to a hub. with that said, i will buy any dlc when it comes out.",1
the music is very relaxing and calming while the game pumps your mind into the world of infinite thinking. idk what to write. this game is fantastic for a cheap game.,1
ah the good old days looking up hacked versions of papa's pizzeria because i was bored where did the days go,1
"jade empire is like the forgotten step child in the bioware universe. it's always the last to be picked for kick ball, but then out of nowhere it kicks a grand slam to win the game. basically you may have passed it up at first, but you don't have to make that mistake again.",1

"this game is quite alot worse then all it's predecessors imo, so if you're considering buying this based on the previous assassins creed games, i would suggest trying it out before buying.",0
"destination sol experience? less than stellar. as soon as i had finished the tutorial and had enough cred for a ship with a heavy gun, i bought it, and the trusty blaster disappeared. without any other weapons, the only choice i found was to go to a nearby planet and wait for rocks to fall from the sky and produce coins, then find someone who actually sells heavy guns. i'm not that patient. could this have been more fun if i hadn't been whacked by bad purchases? maybe, but throughout everything, i definitely felt like i was getting what i paid for.",0
"this game gives you the feels and lots of it. gone home is a very short and simple point and click game that through great voice narration, draws out a rare experience in video games. i completed this game in about hours and had a blast extensively looking through everything, making sure i got everything there is to the game. as a bonus added fun, after i beat the game, i collected all the journal entries, buttons, and cassettes. the only negative i have to say about this i wish there was more!",1
this is some good man.,1
it's a free game.. you cant hunt animals or basically do anything without paying real money,0
a very fun and interesting game. strongly recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle theme games. . out of,1

"this game is great. i just started it, but i mean i just have to write a review about sooner or later. right? if you like games where you walk and fight enemies on your way, this is what you need to get. i like the idea that you can range attack and hand to hand combat and the story makes a great first impression. like, shank i hope that's his name , he started as a prisoner and they start to get hi-jacked by these goons and everyone leaves. except for one person, shank. he sat there, stood up to them and ed them up. can't wait to finish this game. that's a great way to show that you can face your fear right there.",1
"runs at the speed of a rock, delayed keys, couldn't even get the bread on the floor this game ran so bad. i like to think i have a nice pc, not too good, but runs things nicely. this game ran slower than anything i've ever played before. i have to say i'm dissappointed because i was excited to play this. refund please.",0

"it pains me to click the thumbs down on this one, but, it's hard to click the yes for 'reccommend'. the game is adorable, and soooo pretty, and full of charm, yet, sadly, it's an adventure game, and it must be held to certain standards, set by others before it. the game itself, is very very short. the puzzles, while neat at first, turn into things you'd never ever figure out, without a walkthrough, and, then, just like that, it's over. i'm talking, hour over.. the game is more like a demo, or a concept sample, than a compete game, and it's a crying shame, cause, it has such a wonderfull style to it's audio and visuals..",0
"the only bad thing i can say is that this game is short. i 'beat' the game after about hours. while i skipped most of the side quests ok i feel silly saying side quests in a game that features a giant nazi aborted fetus as a boss i still had a ton of fun with this. the whole game feels like a south park episode, so if you're a fan you will love this. rpg fans will love the jokes and spoofs about rpgs, so stop being elitist as and have fun ok.",1

"earlier this week on stream i was recommended by a viewer to purchase and play this game. prior i had no knowledge of how to play i took it upon myself to learn and try to complete the game. as i've spent nearly hours on the easy and first level of the game, i've came to the conclusion that this game isn't actually possible to complete as the guards will always catch you, whether you max out your stats and collect all keys, if you steal the guards uniforms, and even try to clip the gates away. there will always be a variable in the game that will force you to restart from scratch because the guards will later raid your cell and you'll be forced to start over. do not recommend, out of i now have squirrel aids. squaids. it's rare.",0

"the game is great, but if your speniding money on an isaac game, buy rebirth. its worth the extra money, every penny. this game is like a rebirth demo, i know it came out first but its outdated so if youre trying to decide between them, dont buy this one.",0
"currently unplayable. since the last patch i can now play day one. however, anytime i go near the escape key the game crashes. when it tries to load up day two it crashes then also. still can't get past day . as soon as it tries to load day it crashes. have tried all of the suggestions below. having vsync off wont even let me get to day . getting a little bit frustrated. if not fixed soon i will have to get a refuend, which will be very disappointing. from what i have played so far i really like the look and feel so i hope that this can be resolved. this is my final review. have decided that since the game is presently unplayable, i have deleted the content and had the game purchase price refunded.",0
regret buying this and wasting time on it.,0
this game sucks it is so hard and borring at some parts!,0
sucks no multti player like it says and cant even get full screen money back please !!,0
"dandelion is a wonderful game. it deals a lot with depression and loneliness. the story is well thought out and well written and allows for a great deal of play time. the gameplay it's self is not my favorite, i find the 'choosing what you do for the day' mechanic to be kind of boring and a waste of time. the story has a lot of mysteries to it that slowly unfold as you play through, dealing both with the main character's personal problems that she needs to work through, and the guy's stories. something i don't care for is that have to choose who you want to pursue fairly early in the game before you've actually had much time to get and know them. you do not get to interact with them as humans until you've decided, which is a little annoying. it doesn't matter much on secondary playthroughs, but on the first playthrough it feels like you just have to guess as to who you're going to like.",1

"blue shift has one of the most horrible single player games ever. i had more fun playing the free single player games in hl mods such as azure sheep very good and case closed super short, though better than bs . do not buy this game! having played tons of free mods and opposing force, blue shift sucks big time. opposing force gives you cool new guns -- buy that instead if you really want to. blue shift was clearly phoned in as a project and that's why it sold poorly. the only good thing that bs added to hl was better quality textures, which you will get anyway if you buy any hl product. there is no reason to buy this garbage. it has a promising beginning and a new security guard model, though it is downhill from there. don't let this game be a downhill of your wallet. all i can remember from this game is that it was frustrating and boring as hell and it ends suddenly as if the budget ran out. it is even worse than gunman chronicles, a retail half-life game too weak to get on steam.",0

this game is badly addicting. gameplay is only click and waiting noting more. well what else to expect from the game title. if you do not want to just sit and waste your time do not get this game! seriously. well the game is good for kids but still i do not recommend it.,0

sword coast legends would appear to have the right stuff at first glance. but down to the core just doesn't feel like d amp d in the same way neverwinter nights did. i'd consider the interface and gameplay kind of kludgy. it all feels rushed to me. i'd really like to say the time i spent with this game was fun. i only played during the free weekend and ultimately i didn't feel like forking over the to keep playing.,0
