"meh..great graphics, buggy as hell. lose an overlay, have to restart. make a mistake, have to restart. great concept done in a very badly designed way. late game is very laggy. traffic and economic rules don't make any sense, this game is light years better than most of the other city building sims, but still light years from a fun, latest generation city builder. i rate it a out of .",0
"free to play, but generally a waste of time. it took me minutes to finish this game, along with getting every achievement. if you really wanted this game, i wouldn't stop you from downloading it- but i definitely wouldn't suggest it.",0
"it had a few glitches seems to be much better after the most recent update. i like it much better than . the ai is still not that great, but it has improved with the patches. overall i enjoy it",1
"terrible, runs terribly on my pc, aven though the graphics aren't that intense. bf run better. story reminds me too much of wolfenstein the new order and feels like i'm just playing a bad reamake. wish i had my . back, do not buy this game it's not worth the download time wait and most certainley not worth your money.",0

"bloodlust shadowhunter is so unremarkable that i honestly find it difficult to properly review. like, okay, it's almost entirely the work of one man i understand that completely. in some ways, i'm even genuinely impressed, its visuals, atmosphere and overall concept all commendable under the circumstances. the audio work? amateur at best, on par with a high school mixing lab project in a world where competent bedroom producers are a click away, there's no reason not to aim for better. now that's not to say this wouldn't be reasonably excusable if the gameplay was of any worth, but in this case, it most certainly isn't. honestly, i'd go so far as to consider the gameplay botched beyond belief, by far the most damning of all flaws, painfully slow, janky controls and borderline broken a.i. entirely baffling in their sheer levels of ineptitude. is what ruins bloodlust shadowhunter in its entirety, the proverbial fate-sealing nail on the coffin. long story short -- stick with vampire the masquerade - bloodlines a buggy mess, sure, but infinitely more enjoyable in comparison.",0
stay clear. unless you collect trash like me.,0
"even running this at x speed, this game is padded to hell and back. the microtransactions work, at least, but who needs that when you've got blatant copyright violations comin' out the ears? assets stolen from other work, sounds stolen straight from ',' this has got it all.",0
"killing floor is one of those games that never gets old no matter how many times you play it. it's addicting, tense espiscelly with the hell on earth difficulty , action-packed, pretty good fps, and you gotta love that terrible yet tolerable voice acting. the only downside is the amount of servers there is anymore. in - there would be up to servers, but now all i can get is at the highest, shame to see such a great game lose its playerbase in that amount of time, but i digress. so basically, buy the game now before everyone's gone.",1
"i wanted to like this game but it just does everything it can to become tedious and boring. the combat is as generic as it gets, with you constantly bashing just one button because it's actually more efficient than using any of your skills. quests are also terrible as you have to kill rabbits or bats, collect some flowers while running around in a huge landscape filled with the same stupid bandits, goblins and wolves which you have to fight because running away from them is almost impossible as you have barely have any stamina. the fact that the fast travel is restricted to cities and a few crystals you find trhoughout the game is also frustrating as you have to spend most of your time running around empty ladscapes.",0
while worms armageddon and worms world party were the crown jewels of the worms series currently worms reloaded is the best choice if you are looking for classic cartoon-style worms gameplay. pros classic gameplay and graphics fast loading times great multiplayer cons maximum worms per team limited gameplay configurability limited arsenal compared to worms armageddon and worms world party boring single-player campaign,1

"terribly released, a substantial amount of people, easily in the hundreds, cannot even get the game to load and there are countless problems past that. without word from the devs for hours in the hours following release. which is a shame because it seems like there is a good game under there. however -- steer well clear, that's neither steam or capcom will refund.",0

"what the hell happened? what should have been a shoe-in for an amazing game, somehow got smashed and mashed in it's hd makeover. it looks great, and on the surface, everything seems okay, but the controls man, the controls have taken one too many hits, leaving them slow to react and a bit of a general fustercluck.",0
fun game it's really fun to play when your bored.,1
"i love this game, however for me, the game stutters and makes it hard for me to enjoy it at its fullest. i'd reccomend playing this one a console rather than the pc. some ports aren't meant for the pc",0
"this game has a sick sense of humor when it comes to critical rolls. played two games, and none of my catching rolls were good enough to succeed. and that was when my thrower was actually able to pick up the ball in the first place!",0
warframe was the first shooter game i owned. then it broke and i couldn't open it again for a year and a half. i evenutally deleted it and reinstalled. now it works like a charm and i can't wait to get back into it,1
"very fun gameplay is involved with this new batman offering. the fear takedowns are pretty awesome, as well as the batmobile gameplay. the ui is also more streamlined to match the new suit. i will say that the graphics are rather dated and washed out. the performance issues are present, as well, so take caution before buying. my build includes i k, msi gaming mobo, gb of ram, and a titan x. on p, i'm getting a pretty consistent fps, after unlocking the frame rate. i would suggest currently purchase only with either a titan x, fury x, sli, or sli for these performance numbers. if you keep it locked down at fps, you might be alright with a single , , or x.",1
great game you kil zombies you bulid and defend its fun but hard and endless night endless fun,1
if you like lots of clicking and little action then this is for you.,0
bad storyline and bad voice acting ill give it out of .,0

"really fun, and amusing world war ii based game from valve. you're gonna die alot due to veterans, but it's still fun as heck even if you die all the time.",1
"the disappointment of the last decade for me! project cars was meant to be the ultimate simulation. the physics of rfactor , the laserscanned tracks of iracing plus their great online community and partly realistic graphics. first apart from the graphics they reached none of their goals. they said real racing drivers helped them to develop the physics but i, as a guy who has driven a formula renault . car, can say that it is sht, the cars have way too much grip and are way too forgiving. for example you can brake almost mtr. later than in real life but you just lock up and understeer of the racing line if you turn in but you do not spin and still get a decent line to overtake. so i think this game is even worse than the good old shift in my opinion because we are years on now and the handling has not improved in the slightest only the graphics are good",0
launcher wont work.. trying to reinstall the game now. out of best launcher,1
a must have for any vr-owner!,1
waste of money. game was extremely short and just seemed to finish quickly. did the developers run out of money and suddenly decide to quickly end the game??,0
"i don't think i've ever played a game more beautiful than this. you will not regret buying this game, as it takes you on an amazing journey through a dying man's memories.",1
this game is not worth ur time dont download it,0
the game is very god but its boring because all planets have the same missions,0
i fully admit i bought this game only because i needed something to tide me over until gta comes out for pc. don't fall victim to my fate. it's a mediocre sandbox console port with middling-to-bad performance on a gtx and k wherein the only clothes you can wear are various reskins of a jaunty hipster trenchcoat and every contextual action is 'press q to hack.' ugh.,0
"stranded in an underwater city, you have to survive. it's a cool twist on a old steampunk-like city.",1
a masterpiece of the diablolike genre.,1
before saying bad things about the developer team i want to say i really liked this game's idea that it's trying to show you. this game could have a great story with good gameplay and optimization. i don't know what was going wrong on the side of the developers to leave this good concept as a motherboard burning software. garry's incident is only a dollar on the sales but it is very sad this game doesn't worth for it. i really liked the concept. if there will be a less more good gameplay i would play it for hours. do not be curious about this game it is an unfinished project and you'll regret for buying it.,0
"xcom meets game of thrones? this should have been my favorite game ever. this is such a disapointment. watered down tactical combat, the whole research time mechanic is a copy paste from the xcom game design, even when it doesnt make thematic sense. there's really nothing brand new here and for some reason, there's no customization at all. can't even rename your own characters, or change their house name and sigil. i had high hopes for this one and they really dropped the ball.",0
"i love this game, but i can't seem to get past the character creation screen. every time i press play, the game locks up and closes.",0
pay-to-win game..dont bother..dont encourage the play-to-win system. fu cking capitalism,0
"the ultimate bait and switch, that results in a sore as well. edit it's being investigated for false advertisement. that alone is enough reason to stay clear of this game.",0
amazing game but the added safes and drills for weapon skins i dont like because overkill promised no microtransactions otherwise amazing,1
i'm on a mac.. it says is compatible.. but i can't even download it on a mac.,0
"i stopped buying ubi games for a reason, but decided against my better judgement to give this a shot. i will never buy ubi again. ubisoft proves it still hates customers. servers were down day one on launch and they didn't even have the balls to compensate for the down time, nor to even let people know what was going. they grab your money and disappear. also, you can t even go prone or duck in this game. this is an fps and you can't even do basic movement. since this game was made for consoles and is just ported to pc there is the ability to have an aim assist. there is litterally an aim bot built into this game. any form of skilled pvp is imposibble. you can't even enter all the buildings surrounding you. it's literally just a corridor shooter, not an open world in any form. character customization is a joke. you have such limited options i have no idea why they even added it to the game. and the characters you can chose from are just horrific looking. the artists for this game need to commit suicide. skip this trash.",0
"this is a great game for the boardgame-lover out there. it's like 'settlers of catan', assuming catan was high up in the clouds and instead of settling it, you were actively destroying of it to fund a war. good times.",1
please fix game. game wont launch. i have tried everything.,0
"it is very good and the co-op is entertaining, plus the first person and third person are amazing.",1
i dont like this game ide give it a star rating.,0
not too shabby but i wish there was more to it,1
can't play with just a keyboard. not sure if it's just me or not but the game only works with a xbox controller? also i can't raise the resolution to so not sure again but to have these problems right off the bat.. not to mention online multiplayer is discontinued. even though i got this for cheap to me it's unplayable so unless i invested in googling for the answer. therefore as protest i will not bother and i will accept that this game is crap. thank you and good day.,0
"you should definetly try this one , since its the best free to play on steam.its not a gta mmo but its close , diferent and good.",1
you may think that this game is a teeny bopper game but once you have met the characters and got past episode character development the story kicks into overdrive. be ready for ups down and the best feel train you will ever be on.,1
calling all pilots!! needs more american force aircraft. great game sim!,1
very fun game with good replability. i only wish it had multiplayer to play with friends.,1
"horrible. deinstalled after trying to play it for minutes. when i somehow finally got into some server, it was all empty. this might be beta but its far from playable. the engine might be perfectly fine but the client is unstable as hell. couldnt even exit the game without freezing and locking up my pc. they still have a long way to go and improve. as i said i knew it was beta, i'm just stating how the game is right now. the game could have a future if they improve lotsa things.",0
not even alt-f works. what a load.,0
"i think there are very few experiences that can match up to the likes of abzu. seriously, this is one of the few games where i had emotional moments. it's astonishing, seeing as there are very few games that can really bring out that side of me. in my honest opinion, you have to give this game a shot. for , you get to experience about hours of glorious ocean. amazing.",1

"i wonder if they actualy even thoughtfully tested thier game before releasing it. because the physics feel wonky. the geometry, lightning and textures is offen broken. alot of clipping, models 'see through area' exposed, inconsistent texture quality lightning killed by a spinning blades on that was on the other side some bars. nice. lightning guard's just suddenly jumping through the wall to steal my precious guns. killed by a fire jet that i thought already was safe to run over. lovely. no, i didn't run into it getting my nuts roasted to a crisp, but apperantly that one little part of the sprite that was pretty much gone apperantly was enough. hearing 'this baby could put a smile on anybodys face' for the th time isn't funny yes i know you can mute it but what about the other lines that don't play so offen and the list goes on. i mean it's definitly fun playing. but consistently experiencing these bugs and other flaws really just takes away most of it. it's worth giving it a shot if it's really cheap on a sale. otherwise don't waste . on this.",0
"if you ever wanted ets , but in us then this game is exactly that. nothing significant changed. after the recent re-scale update the map size feels just right and i say this as someone who tried the demo and didn't want to buy the game until the scale is changed. kudos to scs for owning up to their mistake.",1
"not fun. get cities skylines instead similar name, different developer .",0
"there have been some pretty big updates since i last played this game, but when i played it, for the first two weeks or so after it released, it was one of the most enjoyable games i'd played. it takes a little bit to get used to the maps, and to learn the hang of kicking and some of the other unique controls in this game, but once you do, it is easily one of the most enjoyable multiplayer fps experiences i've ever had. i wholeheartedly recommend trying it especially since it's free .",1
arguably the most challenging tropico there is. limited handouts and it seems far more easy to get booted from presidente in this than any sequel. makes for a great classic to play.,1

"ok, so let me break it down for you. today i went to go play barbie and her sisters puppy rescue. i opened the game several times, and it kept on crashing. what a same because i wanted a world record in this game, because i am a speedrunner. i don't have time to explain what a speedrunner does but, i will sum it up. a speedrunner is someone who plays games fast. ok good, now if you could fix this game and not question why i am spending my time playing this game and i am also a male adult. thanks for the game steam, i really wanted barbie to rescue those puppies.",0
"i really can't recommend this game. the finickiness of the jumping puzzles, the incredibly slow pacing of the story, and the repetitiveness of the gameplay make this a very boring experience.",0
it's a total mindblowing game !! wasteland universe is sick and thoses graphisms are stunning!,1
do not buy this game. it shouldnt have been released in such a horrible state on steam. never managed to finish a round in the game without - players just crashing out of the game.,0
it won't let me play online. it'll host lan but won't let me host online.,1
it's fun but needs player housing,1
"i would pay the original price i paid for this game to take back the time i spent playing this game. this is the worst game i have ever played. graphics hell the original cod had higher res textures in certain areas. story the story is less indepth than the original doom. gameplay this part is exceptional..ly bad, i played on hard and was bored the entire time.",0
"pretty, no bugs, and you get what you were told. no the best game of the millenium, but worth its price yif you like the genre.",1
"i love this game in the same way that i love peanut butter. i will have normal amounts of it, then get sick of it. then i will repeat that in this game, i will sit for minutes and play, then i'll get frustrated. then, i'll do it again in a couple hours. much recommended, however, i wouldn't devote endless gaming time to it. still loved, though. thank you, cousins, for finding this game for me.",1
"nothing fancy, simple shoot 'em up in the sky game. the game is more inclined towards shooting than simulation and control. if you want a relaxed air combat shoot 'em all game, this one is for you. don't expect much in terms of graphics.",1
"this is a beautifull game, great story, absolutly beautifull, and great voice acting. i have seen the other reviews, and yes it is short, and no action but you know what? the story is so well wroghten it does not need action gt 'its a walking simulator' i correct you ' its a well made waking simulator with a damn awsome story!' out of",1
i can't believe this game is this game. mind blown.,1
the rating for this game used to be positive now it's negative haha,0
"a stunning display of what can be done on the pc if the developer pours their heart into it, stunning graphics, a great story, amazing voice-acting, all set in the gritty world of the triads in hong-kong. the fighting engine is something to get used to, but it's really polished once you do. the gunplay is functional but obviously not the focus of the game. it took me a good hours to get through the game with completion and something like another with the dlc. i strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes freeroaming, action-packed sandbox games in the style of gta, but not a direct clone itself",1
can they make zombies any more boring?,0
"you know when you back up your car and hit your cat, killing it by squishing it's organs to pulp? this game laughs at your suffering and executes your parents. gaben wants your money, and will take it from you. gaben's model looks like a untextured fat albert model from the psx era, the enemies come straight at you and instantly kill newell, and the gun barely works. i shut down this pile of , then refunded it. do not buy, make gaben poor!",0
your saying hats don't make you better. words of a wise mann.,1
this game stoped working after year saying this message named bottil game must be up to date. my first steam game is gone cause of this t.can you fix this or not or is my game screwed otherwise i will have no choice but to delete it,0
worst tank-chasing simulator ever out of,0
this game is so broken is pathetic. why should i haft to go through all these issues and fixes for a game that just launched. test your games before you release them.,0
"i really enjoy the ecomony mechanics but this combat makes me wanna yell.. its amazing how a bandit hide-away can steal everything from trade routes and grind your colony to a halt. the early combat makes it impossible to kill the bandit camp, i've spend the past game years trying to elimanate them but can not. i'm obviously missing something major regarding combat, and can't seem to even put a dent in them. combat seems pretty ridiculous, even with food business's telling me they are making more than needed. get ready for 'we've been away from our camp for not even a week and i'm hungry and my feet are sore. com'on army, back to base! leave the last men from that unit so they can replenish!' not only will i not get my money back, even worse i wont get my time back..",0
unresponsive controls. sometimes pickup doesn't work. a lot of struggling to get controllers to work. unskippable dialogue cutscenes. hard to click on ui buttons.,0
would not reccomend this game because it is exactly like the first counter-strike. same stuff. waste of money.,0
another piece of of a game. don't even try to waste your money on this . can't defend any type of attack. and can't hit anyone.,0
"i'll save you from reading all the reviews don't buy this game, it isn't worth it.",0
the starting mission in the game was ok. it actually felt more like a single player experience where you progress through the story. sure all you did was fight enemies and progress to the next location but it least it felt like you were doing something. then as soon as i start the first missions in the open world it is just fetch quests where you have to collect a certain amount of things by fighting enemies and then turning them in.,0
the greatest game for every player who likes fps and dont have enough money to buy games like me! - lots of castumazation - teambased multiplayer and co-op - dlc - dayly new co-op missions - you wont get bored from this game so soonly!,1
"i remember playing this when it was an html game hidden in the corners of the internet. a simple google search would not find this. after searching through indiedb for a while, i found this. i loved it, but because of its unorthodox name, i forgot it. now, after searching for a year, i have finally found it, here on steam. its a great rts. play it.",1
"runs great, even with all settings maxed it's free -too easy for too long assuming it gets harder , makes upgrades feel unnecessary. when i play a grindy game i like to need want the loot i earn, so it just didn't work for me. even after limited play time it's clear that some of the items-that-i-don't-care-about will require you to grind until the rapture. out of would suit outdated-hardware owner with poor gaming skills, no money and all the time in the world",0
"for a fighting game to remain competitive it needs the developer to support it. unfortunately, the pc version will not receive any new content or the recently announced online netcode update. great game marred by poor business decisions. real shame.",0
perfect balance between serious and hilarious moments gg,1
a great game let down by steam undeniably the best gta game purely for the mods and addons. but.. relies on drm that no longer exists - you will find yourself twatting about for ages getting downloads from third part sites just to get the offline save-game to work - as for multiplayer - just forget it. hardly the 'download on steam and click play' experience that it ought to be. bitterly disappointed in steam on this one.,0
"a free-to-play gem of a little visual novel that shouldn't be overlooked. it's a short but bittersweet story, with breaktakingly beautiful art. while the story is tragic, it's still got an incredble underlying message that is highly inspirational. this would make a great introduction to the visual novel genre for a first-timer, as well. i would love to see more from the developer of this game, they have great potential to create wonderfully elegant stories and memorable characters.",1
"for what your paying just get ets . this game has very few trucks, states. so not worth it go spend your money on another game.",0
only if you find pleasure in melting pcb,1
i'm new to the thief series. i must say i'm very impressed so far. x unreal engine is working good. .ini files still allow for further game optimization. core cpu showing good utilization across all cores. ui is good.,1
"the game completely relies on you upgrading a plethora of skills in hopes that one of these skills will save you in future conversations and actions. not being given any indication as to what is to come in the future, you will find yourself missing out on huge hunks of plot and possibly dying because a few stats were not high enough. everything feels random and without any idea of what i should maybe be specing toward, i feel bored and just choose skills at random. this is all the game has to offer as well. also, there is no real humor to it like the trailer suggests so i felt somewhat lied to.",0
you i got a mac come at me brah,0
"extremely simple but very fun to play. later levels become pretty difficult, and it always keeps you on your toes. i've found hours of gameplay in this simple and very cheap game, and i hope everyone else does as well.",1
"one of my favorite ps games is now on pc. pros well optimized port includes previously released dlcs now at gt fps and p and higher stylized graphics, memorable music and satisfying gameplay likable characters, every unit being unique helps a lot story is ok. may be a bit too animeish for some peoples tastes cons -pre-rendered cutscenes are p -is it me or are the in-battle character voices a bit hard to hear? -this game is not for you if you can't stand the anime style and can't overlook it for the gameplay i hope to see the sequels on the pc as well. i'm also hoping for more good ports and hd re-releases from sega. games like vanquish, skies of arcaidia, jsrf and shenmue would be great.",1
this game consistantly crashes as soon as i try and join a server. i can reproduce it of the time.,0
it's not worth the time,0
"a side scrolling sandbox game that's a nice tribute to -bit games, terraria captivates with adventure and hilarity as your avatar traverses the depths or heavens in search of riches and glory. craft masterpiece halls and glorious castles to hold plunder whilst defending it from hordes of zombies, undead, slimes and clowns..",1
a friend told me that i had to buy this game and that if i didnt like it he would mail me a check. so far its been the best bucks i have spent.,1
"this game is amazing. the level design tells a story. the difficulty tells a story. the only thing that doesn't tell a story is the actual story. killing is hard at first for our young jacket lets imagine you as jacket trying to master the controls, the tactics and the weapons of the game . as you play more and more the levels get harder, but the killing gets easier.. instead of only enemies or so per level lets say you have about . the more jacket kills the easier it gets. the devs did an amazing job with this concept, the gameplay is amazing the 'story' is amazing. overall, hotline miami is an amazing game for those players that like something that will make you rage, punch a penguin and possibly cry. out of",1

"'a solid third-person shooter that delivers intense action and a compelling setting, but relies too much on established mechanics, rather than delivering something new. the story however really stands out - a grim and challenging reflection on violence is something you won't find in any typical shooter. fortunately it's also missing that dull patriotism you've come to expect from today's military action games.' - pc games germany very underrated, i like the story line, the twist, and beautiful destroyed dubai. out of",1

"it was a brilliant story until the ending , but the gameplay was mediocre. the concept of tears was brilliant, but the skyhook idea was outright stupid. next to no replayability as opposed to the original bioshock, which i go back through at least annually. the only reason i havent uninstalled it yet is that i'm waiting for the season pass to go on sale. but i will probably never play the base game again. glad i waited for the autumn sale to get it for instead of wasting on it at release. did not live up to the hype. . out of",0

"don't buy this if you are looking for the original homeworld with updated graphics. this is a glorified homeworld mod. all the mechanics and controls that made the original such a joy to play are gone. there is a copy of the true original game in the package and it appears to be stable, but you are severely limited in options for resolution. disappointed. the hw remaster was a hack job.",0

"this game is amazing in every way. for one, they threw in interesting and informative historical facts about wwi as the story progressed, which i found very cool. the story is compelling, the characters feel real, the music is beautiful, and the landscapes and backgrounds look great. once i started this game i played straight through, i just couldn't stop. and games don't usually get to me emotionally, but by the time this one ended, it was all kinds of dusty in my room. i found this game to be extremely immersive, and one of the best buys i have made from steam. i highly recommend it to everyone.",1
"looks great and is full of atmosphere, although it's more or less on-rails and the xenomorph becomes more of an annoyance than anything once you get used to the mechanics. still, if you let yourself get lost in the experience the game has its moments and messing with the alien while playing hide-and-seek never gets old.",1
"i once had a lengthy stay in a hospitol myself and wishing for a death that never came. the only human contact and touch was a nurse who burned holes in my skeleton arm. the silence, the noise, the light the dark. the doctors, the money. the pain the pleasue. oblivion. but at least i had more fun doing that then playing bad rats the rat's revenge",0

"out of , allow me to explain. when i heard of this game, a storymode of minecraft, i thought there was going to be a story of how it all came to be, why steve has to build his way through the world, and for what purpose. playing this game, all i could think about is a 'interactive cinematic'. there was hardly any 'gameplay', more like pressing a button that changes the scene, many giving you options for the same path. however, this is the first telltale game that i have ever played. that being said, i believe i will have a better understanding of what i should purchase and play when the next opportunity arrives.",1

"a semi-hardcore platformer based on suicidal squirrels. first thing that you need to know is that the movement goes by momentum - similar to genesis sonic. slow start, goes faster over time it makes controls a bit harder to grasp, and some stages require tight maneuvers. overall once you get past the controls barrier, you'll find a rather challening platformer. stages aren't long, so the game can be played in short bursts. overall difficulty - out of",1

"clicker heroes is an awesome game. the art style is great, the gameplay fun, and having new people to introduce into your lineup of characters is unexpected for a game like this. it is an rpg-ish game where you play as cid, the main character. there are also some really good ways to level up cid fast! like, for example, if you just beat the first boss and then repeatedly beat him over and over again my strategy . overall, i would recommend this to anyone who likes games such as cookie clicker. it is a great timewaster and kept me entertained for hours!",1

"very difficult to install - takes too long, a lot of changes from rome which means a longer learning curve, taking away the fun of playing easy, fast moving games. i suppose the developers expected all of us to spend all our time learning and playing this game, which is not possible especially if you are otherwise gainfully employed. good graphics but limited scope for enjoyment since the game is so unwieldy. i have also experienced a lot of crashes, so obviously game engine robustness is an issue. once i get some time i will write to ca with my issues and hope they can fix them. i've hardly played a few hours and i am already feeling the strain of crashes and reinstallations of a very unwieldy and overdone game. looks to me like certain sections of code need some drastic rewriting to cut some fat from it. maybe some of the in-game complexities can be removed. i feel like a good patch can fix this. i wouldn't recommend this game to a newbie. stick to empire, which is a far more robust game.",0

"nice visual novel for one single playthrough. i was excited about wooing other characters after i made sam my loyal pardner in crime but the excitement and my boner wasn't worth it. your neck always ends up being ravished by every male character. the sex scenes and the lines stay the same. the only things that change are the names and the cg you just read over and over through the same text. true, it was interesting in the first playthrough but then the writer became so lazy about writing different scenes and different lines for every character it almost made me drop a tear of disappointment. the writing and the voice acting was good malix and diana rock my socks off all this hard work felt a bit wasted. every character should be unique it their own way. unfortunately it felt as if they're clone stormtroopers. the bloopers are the only thing i enjoyed from beginning to end. great job at voice acting.",0
"don't waste your money on the pc version. the game does not save. they've known about this problem for over a year and haven't patched it yet, and on the forums there's a sticky that just says they know about it, with no advice on how to fix it. this means the game is almost completely unplayable. you would have to beat the whole thing all in one shot to make it through. do not waste your money on this game.",0
amazing story line!! well developed characteries!! if it was a tv series i would watch it!,1
"out of this game is great! i have loads of fun using mutators, like the jetpack goat! you can have so much fun playing this game. the rest of the dlc looks great, and when i get it, i know it'll be awesome to play! i definetly recommend this game.",1
"machinarium is a really charming game. between the music, visual designs, and incredibly challenging puzzles, you can tell that the designers put all of their heart into this game. and i found myself putting a lot of heart into the protag robot the game is so charming that even though it's a very simple 'rescue your princess' story, it's just so much deeper than that. i loved this game. i just wish it could have been longer i managed to beat this game in two sittings. but here's the thing it didn't seem like . hours played. it seemed like i just flew through it because i was enjoying myself the entire time, even when i was stumped by puzzles. and if that's not the mark of a good game, then i don't know what is.",1
"really surprised at how much emotionial this game was. very funny, very sad. understated but engaging art. i'm blown away with what they made with something as simple as rpg maker",1
"unless you really miss 's adventure games and can sympathise with a sociopathic, obnoxious of a protagonist you probably shouldn't play this. lovely art style though, just incredibly tedious gameplay that often leaves you directionless so you end up wandering from screen to screen desperately clicking on absolutely everything in an effort to advance.",0

"battleborn is a good game. maybe even a great game. it has that fun quirky style and humor of borderlands, with fun and inventive characters. but there is a huge flaw in this game. imagine, you work really hard and muscle up dollars to get deluxe edition. you have lots of fun and enjoy it, but they have an update where they try to make you spend even more money for useless skins that have no effect on gameplay. dollars for a taunt and basically dollars for a skin! if the game was free to play i could understand that but it is not. seeing that they are so money hungry truly disgusts me. i used to defend this game and praise it. but now i have not played since the update. to those of whom wish to get battleborn, don't. while it may be fun, you should not condone such behavior. in my opinion micro-transactions are ruining games these days. in short while it maybe fun, do not get battleborn.",0
"'yeah! lightsabers!' you think for about ten seconds. then you start playing and see how dull and easy to cheese it is, while at the same time being unfair by ramping up the difficulty artificially just faster shots instead of more variety . there's not enough there to justify the price. i will come back to it later if there is more to do, and in a better way.",0
"i'll give loadout credit where credit is due, it's pretty fast paced action for a third person arena shooter. the multitude of problems i experienced on launch were hard to overcome but i do understand that launches can be harsh on developers. down to the nitty gritty. you pretty much have to grind matches to get any of the 'good' weapon combinations as you start off with very little 'blutes'. i've never been a fan of grinding in any shooter. on top of that, everyone looks exactly the same. this is because the money making methods from loadout are all through skins. these are paid for in gold, which is different to blutes and can only be 'earned' by buying them for real money and the skins are a lot of money, even when compared to another f p game such as lol. if this was a paid game with all content included instead of f p with microtransations, then i would recommend it in a heartbeat, but i cannot in its current state.",0
"highly recommended, gameplay is nothing too special but the phenomenal story and superb characters make up for this and then some. i would also suggest picking up burial at sea while you are at it to get the complete story. the game is worth every penny, honestly would not of even minded paying full price for this.",1
"i don't really have much to add that other people haven't said already. the mouse smoothing is so bad that if i move my mouse slowly the cursor will just jitter a little to the left. or the right, or up, or down. but no diagonals, if i try to move the cursor in a slow diagonal then it just doesn't move at all. if i move the mouse faster then i can do diagonals too, but the mouse acceleration is so bad that it just ends up right in the corner of the screen. this is all with reducemouselag and doublebuffermouselag both set to false, and mouseaccelthreshold set to in the ini's.",0
"this is a cool game and it deserves some of your time. one of the best soundtracks collection of metal music i've heard. frequently over-the-top characters, scenery, and gameplay concepts. gameplay controls are nicely tweaked to not be annoying, but not be hand-holding either, leaving you free to drive around, kick bad guys butts, and enjoy the story without them getting in the way and causing frustration. has a satisfying conclusion that's worth making it to. parents - gore can be turned off and objectionable language bleeping is also an option.",1
"as of pc vanilla release, - p only - stuttering in battle, frame rate fluctuates from to whenever the hud is present - video and audio options are non-existent - esc key exits the game with no warning whatsoever - unable to remap keybinds on controller - asian ips that purchased the game from steam are locked in with the jp voiceover with no freedom of choice overall an atrocious port that is on par with dark souls pc release. and here i thought se would have already learnt from their past ffxiv failure to not release a half baked game, i guess not! not recommended to purchase. stay away for now .",0

i'll never buy any ubisoft game again.,0
"i profited cents from buying this and selling the cards, i still would not recommend it. the game crashes constantly, it has no mouse sensitivity options, the gameplay is awful. i feel like i'm playing with ms ping even though the game is singleplayer. only game that i've felt compelled to write a bad review for. worst game i've played by far, how it's on steam is beyond me. this game is the strongest argument against freedom of expression.",0
"i like this game a lot even though it seems a lot of people have got themselves a game they had high expectations for. for the record, i never read what some game site writer had to say about it, or any pre-reviewers, i listened to what hello games was saying. it seemed everyone else and i bet a bit of sony as well over hyped the game. i followed from early development and the game has basicly been given to us as it was intended to be, an exploration game. it has some survival elements and gives you a goal for moving forward, and not just 'homesteading' on some nice planet. it's simple. there's noting wrong with simple games. i've played them all from myst all the way through fallout series and more. i love variety. this game gives me a nice niche game to add to my collection. only complaint i have is the price, shouldn't have been a 'full priced' game, but i blame that on sony as well.",1

"couldn't really get into this game although if i had the patience to start over i might of enjoyed it enough to finish it. great graphics, kind of abstract. but if you miss anything or do something in the wrong order, it's hard to catch up and or progress effectively through the story. good for people with a high attention to detail and who can figure out what path to take in a short period of time, just not for me personally. if i hear the conductor tell me i'm at the wrong room again i might cry.",0
"save you money and avoid this 'game'. when a key feature of a game is to dance with your food for seconds before you actually kill it, while being shoot at kills you in hits. someone somewhere needs to rebalance this brick on ice. graphics out of sounds out of gameplay out of i guess it atleats looks pretty. buy it if you want a nice screensaver game.",0

"if you want to run a hospital get theme hospital instead. this game is very similar with less controls. with th you get to increase pay wages and control heating and money spent on researching cures and some random challenges within the game mode. this game has zero controls involved. all you get to do is build rooms, hire fire staff and decorate the hospital and nothing else. i would prefer a hospital game where i can control staff hours, wages, the types of tasks they can perform, break times, charges for each treatment per doctor. i would also make it more realistic and include plastic surgery and post surgery recovery time spent in the hospital bed. throw in a cafe, job posting where i can list tasks, work schedule and skill requirements just to add more to the game. if this game is offered to you for free then take it but don't waste the money on this game. you won't play it very much.",0
this game is great time waster and very addictive. would love to see more additions. worth the download!,1

"hog telling the story of a cursed kingdom and the princess that must rescue her people, nothing original. the game's general mood is childish evil witches, evil spiders, fairies and potions, etc. the puzzles are too much easy and the ho scenes not well detailed sometimes objects are so badly drawn that is impossible to recognize them! . cutscenes are some of the worst i've ever seen. the only positive point is the lack of backtracking since there's a handy map that allows the player to teleport everywhere. i got this game with a bundle and i don't recommend buying it if not with a bundle or heavy discount. if you're a beginner you could like this, but there are better hogs on steam.",0

"this game's all over the place. story is a mess, though it's not hard to tell what's happening. absolutely beautiful, no matter what haters say about id tech . gameplay seems good at first, with a great open starting area allowing you multiple approaches to get through it. but then the rest of the game turns into a linear shooter with insta-kill puzzle areas and mini-bosses that quickly becomes tedious. i hope the developer gets another shot at an evil within to get it right, because lots of potential here, but save your money for a sale.",0
"too short of a game to be worth . it is beautiful and has an alright story. this is mostly a puzzle game and due to it being so short, does not get boring quickly. if you are bad at everything ever like myself, you will die, a lot. this game's controls get you killed a lot if you spam them and you will also die a lot due to the fact that is the only way to figure out some of the puzzles. you could probably beat the game before the hour refund period is even up if you push yourself hard enough to do it. the game gets infuriating at times but it is understandable usually. the collectables are very easy to find as well. the combat system is boring and most of the time you will find yourself running from fights more than actually fighting which is not a bad thing but you normally cannot fight even if you wanted to. i would recommend if it was cheaper, such as . or below, but there are much better games to spend your money on which can give you a lot more enjoyment and time to kill.",0

"firewatch is a very enjoyable wilderness exploration game with a beautiful art style and soundtrack ! it features two likeable, realistic characters whose very real dialogue serves as a delightful centerpiece to this game. the relationship that forms between henry and delilah is artful, funny, and personal. firewatch is a touching story that draws you in and doesn't let go until your whole afternoon is gone! took me close to six hours to complete the first time, without hiking around my section of the park and exploring as thoroughly as perhaps i could have. i absolutely love this game! i will be playing through it again soon, just to choose different dialogue options and laugh-out-loud all over again! . out of",1

"so basically there are two types of video game franchises there's the type which you need to play every single game to get the full story optimal experience, like half-life, or hotline miami. then there's the type in which every game is basically the same in plot gameplay, and you only need the most recent or most highly-rated game, like cod or assassin's creed. this game falls under the second category. it's pretty ok, but fallout is going to be a vastly superior experience, and fallout new vegas was pretty good, so i'd skip this if i were you. i like the open world and the cool side quests, and plot, but the graphics are out of date the latest half-life game came out a year earlier but it looks so much better , the gameplay could use work, and the weapons just have no 'oomph' to them. compare it to wolfenstein the new order. that game has some real badass weapons, you'll see what i'm talking about.",0

"great little sequel to banner saga. they've certainly tidied up game-play, and made it easier to keep organized, and level your units. most of the kinks have been ironed out, but there still were some frustrating times, like having to retake a conversation because you died in battle, or having to load a save file only to have to take the cutscene no skipping non-animated cutscenes , all over again. there was a little bit of imbalance when it came to controlling the two different parties for instance, items were hard to come by with your second party. in terms of story, it was amazing, and beautiful as always, but it ended extremely quickly, and the last boss fight in polar opposite to the first game , was far, far too easy. out of",1
sorta feels like a decent generals mod.. which is to say it's actually worse than the original 'act of war',0

"this is a surprisingly fun tower defense. i thought i'd just give it a try and ended up with a marathon. you have heroes and spells that can help you win the tide of battle. each building has two different upgraded forms with a plethora of extra upgrades to increase damage, or add a special ability. it's not a very long or challenging game, so maybe get this on sale.",1
it's ok.. had i not got it on sale i would have been rather disapointed the games rather short with a disapointing ending sure it looks nice but theirs no repalyability which is a shot in the foot for a hour experience with little plot and is a walk in the park. some of the towns people really rubbed me up the wrong way with their noises as you are just looking for stuff to buy and alot of the stuff to buy is just to allow you to contiune to mine at the same speed as the deeper you go the harder the soil gets slowing you down. would have prefered alot more of the puzzels as they were really the better part of the game.,0
it is fun. it is impossible to solo que though. everytime i get stuck with the most autistic and just horrible teammates. if you want a game to play by yourself this isnt for you. you need to que becuase the people solo queing are legit of the time autism in a nutshell. i try to rank up but it takes so long since have the time im having to regain my elo from all the 'playing' on my team. so if you ever want to play rank i dont recommend doing it by yourself unless you do solo duels. anyone that isnt a want to que hmu becuase im done untill someone that dosent have autism decides to solo que. in other words im never playing again.,0

"if you don't own this game i'd like to ask 'why the hell don't you own this game?' it's basically unique. it looks like an rpg but it has no loot or character progression, its a top down action game that has wizards instead of the usual space marines with guns. the humour in it is very decent and the magic system is amazing. the game is long, and replayable to boot.",1

"wonderful version of one of the greatest games ever. the graphics have been masterfully remastered, including subpixel scrolling for an ultra-smooth experience. the voices have been re-sampled from the original dat recordings and are crystal clear. you can switch between the original presentation and the remastered one anywhere with a single keypress. technically this version is perfect. if forced to critique anything about the game, it would have to be the subtitle sync which seems slightly off, with longer sentences staying on screen long after they've been uttered. a subtitle speed slider would solve this. highly recommended.",1

"is this game done yet? clearly not. this game had a lot of potential but i feel robbed having paid for it in early access. this started out as better looking no room left in hell, but has since then downgraded. the graphics are pretty dated and the game physics aren't so great either. killing a zombie with a melee weapon is hard enough but killing a human player zombie is impossible and really kills a lot of the fun. the multiplayer lacks since it's impossible to play with friends and from what a remember there is no server list and all you can do is auto join. most of the levels feel repetative with no real feel for space. the devs are cons, thinking they can sell a game for with like - levels? i really hope i don't see another game from these guys, terrible terrible terrible game. the devs also flood the comment sections and are generally hostile to any criticism. this game had potential but with its under-optimized graphics engine, they do a poor job on execution. on metacritics says it all. this game is worth full retail and not a penny more.",0

"hell yeah isn't great, but it isn't terrible either. it's a mix of both. let me explain the humor is hit and miss - at times it's genuinely funny, at times it's extremely childish. you could say it's for both kids and adults, but in my opinion that's nonsense and it just isn't consistent. platforming and killing is the heart and soul of this game. it performs well in the killing aspect, especially the finishing mini-game moves, and not too bad in the platforming aspect, but the controls take some time getting used to and the platforming is at times very imprecise, which results in you falling off ledges regularly. and i really disliked the backtracking, even if it's for short distances. this is no metroidvania game. backtracking in this game is an artificial way to extend the game and it's highly unneccesary if you ask me. it is already packed with content so there's plenty of other stuff to do. seriously, if i had the chance to buy this game again i would've waited for a discount. rating out of",0

unfortunately this game is too slow to be interesting. it also has a lot of mobile tendencies that do not translate to the pc. my main gripe is that you need to drag recipe ingredients over the first time to craft. it's needlessly slow and once your ingredients list gets a lot larger it's harder to find them. i say skip it entirely as this is probably not the game you're looking for. it has a lot of good ideas that just fall flat. youtube video craft the word - not good on the craft nbsp,0

"the gameplay is fun, but the bugs can make the experience frustrating. random game shutting down followed by the inability to rejoin your game means you have to wait until your friends are done with their match before you can meet back up with them. the mouse cursor showing up on screen and having to fight the game to get it to go away, only to have it come back again randomly is pretty annoying. fix the bugs, and i say buy it because the gameplay is awesome, but not a moment before.",0
its a scary point n click game i enjoyed it and maybe you will too,1
"lost my save data due to a powercut, couldn't restore from steam cloud because it doesn't work. i attempted to download a save file from the internet, so i could pick up the story where i left it, but that doesn't work because save files are locked to a specific rockstar social club profile. plus, every time i tried to boot the game whilst i was messing around trying to get the save file to work, i had to watch a stupidly long intro cutscene. don't even bother with this game. it's not ing worth the hassle.",0
"overall an okay shmup, interesting twist on the old powerup system that i love so much, but nothing to write home about. there are about as many enemy ships in this game as powerups in a normal shmup, which spread over short waves, is very very few. the game gets repetative quickly. the rest of the mechanics are okay, what you'd expect from an older entry. i don't care about the story, it's a shmup. the sole reason for my thumbs down on this title is the rock levels. i wouldn't have reviewed it otherwise. there are a few levels where you have to jump between space rocks, in a puzzle style, very trial and error based, as-boring-as--straight-hours-of-church bundle of rage-causing monotony. as a huge fan of old games, it's 's style last ditch effort at making the game seem more challenging, longer, more interesting and a bit more unique. it's definitely unique, as it's the first shmup i ever stopped playing when i had already nearly beaten it. i won't play this game anymore.",0

awesome city builder game! despite it misses the action of warfare it's still very addictive and challanging.,1
"great game if your a hockey fan or even just a simulation fan! massivly improved from the st edition, like a different game. much more like ootp, customizable, great interface, new tactical system, way better trading amp constantly improving!",1
"excellent game. when i was first introduced to it, i have to say i was worried i would be dissapointed, but i'm glad i got it. it takes a while to learn about all the components, items, abilities, etc. but what i have found helpful is to have the wiki pulled up on my second monitor so i can learn as i go. once you get the hang of it, it's an awesome game, a good time-waster, and all around impressive for the work of an indie developer.",1
"interesting a-symetrical pvp game, odd design choice to have one side trying to avoid pvp to do pve grinding and level up while the other side tries to catch them. can be fun but often the teams are just terrbily balanced there appears to be no match making whatso ever except going off your level , and as they wiped the level for release you will find a lot of experienced low level players right now. that should fix itself. cant recommend it , it is good and well made but its severely lacking content , there are modes but are variations of the . which i dont like myself. very niche game worth a look if you love a-symetrical pvp games but i think more people wont like it than will so watch plenty of vids to really get a feel for it before deciding. and its very expensive for the content provided.",0
"very fun, best grand theft auto i have ever played.",1
"betrayer is a bad game. it's the kind of quality you'd shrug at if it were a student work. it's the kind of game built off of a handful of vague ideas that never really justify their existence. knowing that it's shepherded by the minds behind f.e.a.r. only adds to its disappointment. despite this, betrayer gets to be an exceedingly rare type of game. one that come dawdling around only one every great while it's inherently fun, fascinating, and beautiful. it's visual style is compelling, even if it makes some sections nigh unplayable. it's combat is janky and slow, but is so unlike anything else it becomes enjoyable. for every negative the game boasts, there's an equally unique and compelling reason to play. it's a rare thing indeed, to be as special a game as betrayer, and if the idea of something like that speaks to you, then you should do yourself a favour and play it.",1
"a damn shame because after reading the requirements this game looked to be a good purchase. however, the damn game won't even get past the title screen as the frames just at the title drop to frame every to seconds.. odd considering the first prototype works rather damn good, but alas.. i'm requesting a refund. if you want to try this game, read up on other comments as this has major problems with amd i found out. if anything, would probably be better as a console purchase.",0
bought this game with all the dlcs on k.inguin for . with no idea of what this was like.. well.. i sure as ing hell didn't regret it! this game is pure awesomeness!!,1

"it used to be extremely fun! rc cars, endless creation, you could do anything. then the update came where things moved to the steam workshop aaaanddd.. the game stopped being fun. it changed just about everything, a lot of the things i loved to do were unable to be done anymore, and, worst of all, the game starts up correctly maybe once on a blue moon. rip garry's mod",0

the hacking minigame of typing is to hard. i love the atmosphere of the game and the lore of the deep web pages but the kernal minigame is to hard for me so i can't reccomend the game unless you're an expert typer,0

pretty sweet game actually. been playing for years. runs perfectly pretty much on all computers.,1

"been a while since i've played an ubisoft game. . .then i found out that both games i decided to get the other day were ubi. anno and heroes vi. last games i'll ever buy from them. between uplay and poor overall performance in both games, it's disappointing.",0
farcry primial its worth the purchase during a sale if you haven't played farcry and yet but overall i feel you are better off playing farcry and they offer more content as far as replay value is concern you can play co-op and multiplayer in fc and while primial may be the best looking one to release in my opinion in awhile it is also the shortest i have played with only major bosses and alot of things are copy and paste from farcry but some positives about primial are you can tame and ride the animals to travel and the control is much more fluid compared to the vehicles in previous games the game itself runs like a dream compared to the other entries no black screens pc reboots or anything if you play straight through the game i would say it might take about hours to complete it ubisoft has also released a new mode called survival i didn't play that mode yet but if they add a co-op mode i will come back and update this review. gamerate out of farcry better bring a big change,1

i cant join servers but i can play singel why?,0
the server needs some serious investment and players below should be restrained from playing more than hours per week for public good.. dota has three stage.. first stage.. poeple with strategy work together and push the game very swift and owning the whole game.. gg second stage.. two teams with equal skill fight untill the very end with well played skill from both team.. even the losing team is learning something helpful from the winning team.. good game last stage.. cancerous stage.. bunch of monkey pick whatever they want regardless the situation and when losing the game they all will blame someone.. gg for your health.. please learn how to deal with those mf.. p gt s good point of the game is report system is limited to points to prevent abusing of usage by kids..,1
dont hug things that only have one eye!,1
this game is very fun. there really isn't anything else to say. it is awesome to play with friends and with mods too from the steam workshop.,1
"finished it in about minutes of playing. first off, let's look at the gameplay. it's text based, so no need for fancy graphics cards or an hd monitor meaning the range of people that can play it grows massively. the music is quite fitting of the theme and isn't just one boring loop which is always nice. what i really liked about this game though, is the message it sends across and how well it does this. it makes you realise what living with depression is like and reminds you to be there for you friends and family. having seen what depression can do and how easy it is to miss the signs, this is a game i definitely reccomend to anyone as somtimes, one good friend is all you need to realise why life's worth living.",1
"after playing this game for hours and something min i can say with confidence that this is a waste of time and money. i had actually just tried refunding this game in hopes i could at least get my money back if i cant get back the time i wasted. however because my time was over the limit i couldn't get anything. im not mad because of this because it was my own fault for buying the game in the first place. but i will say that if steam won't refund people they should at least remove this game, that way no one else buys into this lie.",0
"as a long time fan of the homm series i can say this is not one of the best examples of it. while i did enjoy the campaign story and gameplay, there are a few problems that i could not ignore. for one, the performance is terrible on my computer that should be able to run it very well. there are many points where it lags or freezes briefly while loading something. secondly, uplay ubisoft's game service has given me headaches many times. i can recall not being able to update it and having to go through some ridiculous process to be able to log in. while this game may be entertaining when it works, i can't recommend the hassle that will come along with it. p.s. homm was the best yet we may never find a worthy successor.",0
"the newest patch is a dlc, about the same price of the game..",0

"excellent game, shows that you can make even mundane ideas a really engaging game experience. only real downside is that the game really needs hotkeys, but hotkeys are only enabled as upgrades later on in.",1
while it sounds great you get crap even for a free game. all the good tables cost.,0
"terrible, full of bugs, no reknown saved or stored you loose game progress, you have to build your groups over and over, the skill management has several lvl progress issues, it clearly seems that there is no intention of fixing this bugs any time soon.. i urge steam to have a refund policy or else we will have to take greater legal measures against steam and the developers who keeps feeding ill-gaming experiences and a severe waste of my money and my time.. at the very least every game should have a demo and unrestricted access to daily or at least weekly updates. ps. i played for about straight hours before i realized i lost my progress and fame.. i demand satisfaction!",0
bought this game two days ago. played a little. it's ok. would playu more,1
"i like this one out of all of them, but it is still a game.",0
"its hard to find middleground on the internet. the game is not an inch deep nor is it leagues. its better than spore and empyrion but not as good as others. its beautiful but you have to fiddle with your framerate. but alot of games do this without issue. the lore would make miyazaki proud, but its gotta be looked for. if you get down to it, this is an indie game suffering from alot of hype from alot of people that wanted the ideal mmo, and got a much more introspective journey. i recommend it.",1

needs a lot of work but i'm having fun. as long as they keep updating it an listening to the community it should turn out great.,1
"this game was fun at the begining, but the more 'patches' they release the glitchyer it gets. truelly isn't worth your money nor your time. you have to walk half an hour to get to the closest village city and when you get there you will probably be killed by glitchy zombies and loose all of your stuff. i'm not even saying anything about the fps horible and the lack of pve servers.",0
"- very good game. not a demo. the only people calling it a demo are people who pay attention to the story, and never bothered to play the side missions, or replay anything. - performance wise, good port. - one issue though, binocular zoom and sniper scope zoom mouse sensitivity is completely trucked.",1
"dark fact is perhaps the hardest boss i have ever faced in any game. that said, i much prefered ys ii over ys i magic rapes , but these two games were highly challenging and rewarding. i beat ys i on hard mode, and i beat ys ii on nightmare. there are puzzles in theses games, as well as backtracking. in order to finish these games faster, i had to 'look up' certain information. overall though, there is some replayability, as well as time attack. personally, i would give both a out of . adol is a beast.",1
"game and campaign was fine from what i remember. but the game needs to remove gfwl, as with gfwl shutting down, mp and coop won't work anymore. i will change recommendation and give a better review once gfwl is removed and it's changed to steamworks.",0
says full controller support but it don't pickup my ps gamepad so i won't buy this . every other game with full controller support picks up my ps gamepad without the need to open the commandline and do the developers job for them. bottomline if i have to pay for your game and then deal with ing micro transactions then you should have the ing sense to make sure it does have actual support or make it known which controllers work.,0
one of the best stealth based games i've played so far!,1
"i played this game starting at - so what it says on steam is a lie i have played my fair share of eq. this game was great, the best mmorpg out there. you paid i think around bucks a month for a subscription, and the game was filled with content you could do almost anything this game, it was a challenge to master, you had to talk to people make freinds go on raids groups and work together, then everything when daybreak go ahold of this game. the fire nation attacked they are stomping the few players left in the game into the ground and spitting on them. so now unless they pull somthing spectaculer of this game is just a dust town sadly.",0
"the fandom ruined this game, but the game itself is fun",1
"my game type! very nice game! but you need to and many map, weapon, update blablabla .. you can add coop and multiplayer. i think you need to add auto aim, walk to pad and control. nice combat system, it's very fast, i like that. the art and music're very nice.",1
"disappointing move from the devs to milk players with loots stats from microtransactions. despite promising never to do so. used to be a great game, now not.",0
launcher is in internet explorer and i can't support that.,0
i find this game very fulfilling. knocking people over and peeing on them just to maul them to death afterwards is pretty fun.,1
my 'test of time' nomination as the developers keep adding more and more content to a game that came out years ago for free. it keeps getting better.,1
this game.. this game is the personification of what the epitome of what the games indrustry can make. this game captures every single detail of what a hedgehog would do if it was raceing.,1
best storyin a cod game!,1
i couldn t even play it! on the bright side right click and you will find the delete button d,0

best game ever! better than the first! so enjoyable to play! out of would build a new pc to play this game again,1
"i unfortunately would not recommend enter the gungeon to binding the isaac fans, which seems to be a large part of its base. the game has a disappointing lack of synergies and lack of strategy when it comes to item selection. the binding of isaac has so many micro-strategy decisions outside of the actual combat that make the game intriguing to replay. enter the gungeon's early game does not have this. perhaps it comes later, but it didn't hook me enough to find out. the combat is tight and polished, but ultimately unfulfilling and punishing. i really wished this game would have been more like binding of isaac with guns, but sadly it was not.",0
are u ing update all the time ?? i have to wait day to play because not ready up,0
"as much as i once loved this game it's turned into a bloody nightmare. pay for skins in a bloody coop game with stat boosts? are you kidding? my hours will remain as such and no more of the dlc purchased. goodbye payday, its been fun. also the audacity of using crimefest to push out free updates and then have one of those update involving paying for freakin skins is astounding.",0

"not recommended. for some reason, it tells me my mic can only be used in game, so i can't co-ordinate attacks with my friends.. also, matches are extremely rare? i was on the loading screen for minutes, and still wasn't in a game. i got it for half price, but even that isn't cheap enough for a game that only has gamemode that works for me.",0
"it was ok, but the 'strategy' is superficial. either you need to give us more information on stuff, or have less parameters. -there are certain monsters that you won't know how to fight until you've wasted troops dying to them. -ai is a mess. monster spawning is a chore to deal with too. -the game, like civ has you going in turns, unlike civ though you have to sit through animations for each unit of each other player and npc.. that gets time consuming and annoying. -not intuitive how to sustain and grow your settlements. it'd be nice if it told you when or where the next tile would expand on a city, but its really not intuitive if that info is present.. -bugs.. oh god, so many weird bugs in a hr span overall it was a decent waste of , i got hr of entertainment before getting bored, i honestly wish i would have realized before i'd played past the point of no return literally , because i'm confident i will never play this again",0

gets your brain juices flowin'.,1
"single player while i thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign story, the gameplay itself however is very simple. the game holds your hand throughout the levels leaving very little room for you to find figure things out on your own. multiplayer the multiplayer is like every other cod game, few enhancements, minor tweaks, lots of bugs, many people complaining. the initial start off was, and probably still is, plagued by bloated min requirements, constant fps drops despite having a decent rig, aimbots wallhacks boosters, random ctd's and no dedicated servers. there are a handful of people that have gotten lucky and don't have any issues running the game though. overall, there are too many problems with ghosts right now to consider this a good buy. i'm glad i bought this game at a deep discount but still regret spending for it. out of",0

me before playing shadow of mordor me after playing shadow of mordor o o,1
its a really nice game to play. its an awesome alternative to blizzards star craft . however this game has some slight bugs and connection issues. i feel like the factions need to be balanced more and i wish they did a better job at advertising so this game wouldnt have such a small player base. also the game was a bit pricey for a pretty much'indie' game other than that it is a fun and great game to play.just give it some time and more bug fixes and balancing issues will be fixed.,1

"i am not one for creepy horror games. nor am i one for short games, but this game. i don't know. if i had to sum it up in one word, it would be, confusing. the game is good, it has multiple endings, and i found myself playing through it multiple times just to test out everything. the game as you already know, is a exploration game, but it's narrated really well. instead of just finding pieces of paper that weaves the story, you character, being the protagonist, already knows everything you don't. so when he talks to himself 'matter of factly', it's really creepy because it feels like your are just calmly doing and knowing these bad things. it feels like it's you playing the game. out of would eat my babies again.",1

before this review is read it must be taken into consideration that i have very little expreince with the game but after reading multipul reveiws and playing myself i have come to the conclusion that i have somthing to say. pros - cheap on sale - can run on low level pc's cons - poor graphics - terrible interface menu - no story - mundae quests - no variety of weapons armour - no options menu i.e if you wanted to up your graphics you have to close the game and re-open it - poor combat - small world,0

"when this game first came out there was no way i would have recomended it. the price was too high for what i considered half of a game. however with enemy within and to a lesser extent slingshot the game feels a lot more balanced and interesting. the only real downside i can see now is that you will have to pay extra to make the game whole and will be looking at . gb extra download. if you want to play this game you really need to get the expansion enemy within and slingshot is also recomended but not required, the elite soldier pack is a pass.",1

"as someone who actually beat super meat boy light amp dark world , this game sucks the big one. looks awful. jokes are awful. controls are painful. the fact that you need to get stars in order to progress makes this game grind to a halt after minutes.",0

"hands down best free arpg game on steam as of now. path of exile has gigantic skill trees, and a wide variety of maces, swords, axes, staffs, and wands. different monsters in every area keeps the game exciting and very fun. i'm not really a big fan of arpg or rpg games, but games like poe and dust an elysian tale have really made me a fan of the genre. if you don't want to get poe because you aren't interested in rpg games, then you shouldn't be. the game is free, as you prbably already know, and there's no cons about getting the game. highly recommended for anyone looking for a good game to play. also invite your friends to play. poe is a good game when playing solo. but even better when you have another person to help you on quests. the quests are not very hard on normal, especially if you have someone to help you. overall, poe is a game that never seems to disappoint. it in fact does not get boring as some games might eventually grow to be. i would get poe, because there's nothing to lose, and it is an excellent game.",1

game will not play unless you create a uplay account. i don't want a mother fricking uplay account. it is not in the requirements section of the game but it doesn't even flipping load because i don't have a flipping uplay account and uplay won't launch for some dumb arsed reason after forcing me to make a flipping account for it. fffrrrraaauuuddddd,0

"this game looks lovely, but you're not going to see much of anything different after the first minutes. the 'ghost' has no indication of what attracts him to you, or that he's about appear. this started as a scary thing, but after deaths or so becomes a 'you again.' moment. sometimes you'll be sprinting away, jsut to automatically transition to a little stroll. this sort of makes sense in the game, but its about the silliest thing your character could do in the middle of a landslide. navigating the tricky terrain is the main challenge of the game, and its not fun or engaging. i'm sure vaguely different rock shapes is the realistic way of going about it, but it made this game pretty boring. truly disappointing, because i was excited to try this. honestly i'm into walking simulators, but not this one.",0
"another awesome game by yahtzee croshaw. you should definitly buy it, and try not to kill yourself.",1
while i like the concept i could never get the game to load. i know its a personal problem and it shouldnt concern anyone else thats all i have to say,0
"camera controls are ridiculous once you start heading into co-op. there's a game mechanic where if an enemy patrol spots you, it spawns more enemies. its usually somewhere close to the edge of your screen if you're playing solo. but if you're in a group, it forces the camera to center in the middle of the group, which makes it harder to see the edges of the screen. patrols will get startled immediately because its extremely difficult to react to the enemies even if you're in a tight group. i submitted a refund request, and if you plan on playing with anybody, i do not recommend buying this game.",0
"all the devs needed to do was a clone of x-com with wfb themed elements. they could've even kept the grid, it still would've been a far better game than this garbage. why did anyone think a turn based, action point reliant mechanic would combine well with wasd movement is beyond me. the gameplay is horrible. save your money, play literally anything else.",0

"left for dead is a great game and me and my friends had a great time with going through the campaign. though once we finished it we then visited the mods area. and now we are having the fun all over again. the game itself is great, though the community is gives this game more fun to it especially left for teletubbies . i recommend this game if you have friends who just want to shoot the hell out of zombies.",1
"i really wanted to like this game. being a big fan of what it's trying to mimic, dungeon keeper . it falls short in every aspect that made the other game great. the base building in the campaign is severely restricted, indestructable blocks everywhere. it's way too fast paced, especially compared to what it's supposed to be the spiritual successor of. it has far too many gimmicky functions that just makes it more complicated than it has to without adding any fun to it whatsoever. the narrator talks constantly, to the point where you want to strangle him. a plus though is that it's the same guy who voice acted the mentor in dk just that he is now incredibly irritating instead of helpful and witty. you might like it if you have nothing to compare it to but if you're a fan of dk and you're expecting a dk you'll be disappointed.",0
"when i first saw it, iwas like 'oh the graphics arent too bad' but then i took two steps forward..it seems like all they worked on was the graphics, the walking, flying, chat, voices, etc all suck",0

this game has an issue that has not been fixed after a whole year. lan game does not work. max friend can join and sometimes not even that. nothing you can do will fix it. only the devs can fix their broken game. do not buy this game if you want to play lan it does not work and will never be fixed. thank you.,0

this is not fun. i love twin stick shooters so much .. i do not love this. the mechanics in this game are none short of amazing too bad you will never see them. my expierence with this game you will clear the first or levels of a level set with ease then you will die on one of the last levels and will have to start the entire level set again and again and again.,0
if you have nothing to do and love to start from nothing then this game is the best chose!,1
the game for all gamer to play atleast once..,1
"this is a very fun game, after playing a little of normal, i recommend you to check out some mods, they only add to the experience. the game is not very easy and it can be hard to let go of your world because of dying, but it guarantees you some hours of fun time.",1
"teslagrad is a very beautiful, but extremely unforgiving game. this is not so much a puzzle adventure game as it is a platforming game with some mild puzzle elements. the exploration element does not seem to show up as far as i have seen - most areas have a fairly specific solution without alternatives. if you don't have very sharp reflexes, expect this game to kill you ruthlessly. the pattern and strategy for the first boss, for example, is quite easy to grasp, but the actual execution requires very quick reflexes. i hate to be harsh on such a excellent looking game, but this is a game strictly for platforming fans with little crossover appeal.",0
"evoland tugs at the player's nostalgia so hard that it forgets to accomplish anything else. referencing old game mechanics or design choices makes for a better wiki than an actual game. 'remember random encounters?' evoland asks. i do, and i hated them less than when you implemented them. 'remember when games like this were challenging?' evoland reminisces. again, yes. but your game is not hard and it's not very fun. it's a simple tour of the past. players should keep their nostalgia glasses to remember great, old games. you will not remember evoland.",0

"having played aa since . i was sorely disappointed in aa . it was not what it's predecessor was a highly realistic, slow paced shooter attemting to mimic actual combat. the new one however feels like it wants to be another cod or bf. we already have cod and bf which are both rather generic. the world doesn't need a generic clone of a generic game genre.",0

"if you're into old school weird stuff, this is your game ! it's not that bad, but i still don't recomend it.",0
"the game is a fun at first, with interesting physics puzzles to solve. but then it gets stupid, with puzzles that are more about reaction time and your ability to deal with lots of things going on all at once, than physics problem solving. not recommended due to this bait-and-switch.",0

"this game is not worth .. it plays like a f p game the paid steam version has almost no players. at anytime there are less than people online, making it impossible to find lobbies to join. in the beginning soloing missions isn't very hard in the beginning but gets more difficult quickly. high level weapons must be crafted and require a ridiculous amount of grinding to actually craft.",0

"total war attila seems to be like a poorer version of the total war rome ii. in battle there isn't the zoom camera option to a single unit like in total war rome ii. in addition campaign in this game seems to be way more challenging than in total war rome ii, in a bad way. in total war rome ii, in turn i could raise many armies and capture many new cities, of course not without challenge. in total war attila you can hardly make anything happen in turns. it takes many hours to get anything done in this game. compared to total war rome ii, in attila when i upgrade buildings in my cities to boost food, public order and units, i get only a fraction of the benefits what you could get in total war rome ii. i do all these upgrades and what? still bad public order and mediocre units. this game could have been way better, i hope there are some updates coming.",0
"this game is so bad. i went into a game, screen was black, next moment everyone left the game. the game finally begins and i fall through the ship and then next guess what happens.. i fall through the game. i regret the very few minutes i spent playing this game and i got it as a gift. sorry wolf for wasting your money.",0

"dota is a great game, at least for the first couple hours yes in caps . the most terrible thing in this game is the community. they swear at you for no reason or for just some small mistakes that will not have a big effect on the entire match i.e not denying a creep when playing a support. and that was only one creep . or sometimes you get cussed by a person because of the person's own mistake i.e a lvl faceless void rush to the enemy tower to chase an enemy hero with hp left, and then the void dies while the chased doesn't. the void curse at rubick, his her laning partner for not giving a heal it's like messed up. or sometimes you can also find people being racist. i personally stop playing public matches for like month and i only play againts bots because they don't curse at you . in a month period perhaps , maybe i'll just stop playing dota. unless some miracle or something unexpected happen. and the chance for those event to happen is like . i definitely don't recommend this game i myself actually regret dowloading this",0

"one of the worst 'racing' games i have ever played. people will tell you it's about going fast and doing stunts but it's not. most of your time will be spent trying to figure out just what the level designer was thinking if you play online. most of the tracks are cobbled together messes that have no real flow to them, meaning you'll be doing fine one second then flinging over a guardrail because you didn't turn at juuuust the right fraction of an inch to make the next turn causing you to start over. after a few hours of spamming the delete reset key, it became evident that racing new tracks was more of a chore than fun. stick to the free to play version, this is not worth money.",0
"i played fear and several times, but have not completed this one even once. graphcs and controls are ok, the game is just not a lot of fun otherwise.",0
i really want to like this game. it has a pretty cool mechanic with the gravity being swapped around. the story is ok. the shooting handles well. but i cant play a game that keeps randomly quitting to windows. its frustrating as hell. you die back to windows. cutscene back to windows. paused game for too long back to windows. sigh im glad i got this cheap but jeeze its buggy as hell.,0
"if you like world of warcraft, you'll like the game.",1
a complete improvement on a system that was already great.,1

"out of main reward in this game is biting the hairy neck of some guy, and sucking his blood. this is a complete waste of great looking art. this game could have eally been something, but the game play is really bad. tries to rip off tomb raider and devil may cry, and does a terrable job of it. acting is terrable. it is like a b rate gay porn movie story is stupid! most of the cutscenes are just the camera doing a flythrough at a painfully slow speed.",0

"it 's a good looking game, but the controls can not be maped. game is not playable when you stop fighting because controls seem to stop working and too many controls assigned to each key. the fighting keys should always be single, not multi options. game play is not very good because of the control problems killed at least times by the same guy because my guy stops and does respond to key strokes . i can not get far enough into game to give it a any recommendation.",0
"note, in any way, still worth full price. i have more time than shown here. the review time is just campaign time i believe campaign haven't finished it but so far it's pretty average for a shooter campaign multiplayer actually really solid. zombies the default map is pretty trash. dlc maps are pretty good, but will charge you an additional each. if you want the game for the zombies mode, get any other title. black ops has solid zombie, waw has all the maps for free and plenty of custom maps, and lastly black ops has introduced custom zombies. so i'd only reccomend getting this for the multiplayer. do not buy it for though. buy it on sale or on websites that sell steam keys",0
"beautiful scenery, incredible sounds, terrible gameplay. repetetive mechanics that the devs refuse to fix and are apparently happier watching their game go down in flames. the players are so unhappy most of them are boycotting it. don't believe me? it's been days of playing roughly hours a day since i've seen another human player. and i'm in extremely popular systems around sol. if that doesn't prove anything, i dont know what does.",0

"eh. all jumpscares no substance. ooh quickly hide before he finds you. but he might find you if you're hiding! no. he won't, because you wrote the coding that way, if he didn't see me hide he won't find you. and then you just have to watit for him to turn a different direction and you can walk past him. not even run though you can do that too. i dunno it's probably good for people that like to get jumpscares, but there is no atomsphere whatsoever, when this game loses all 'fear' if you turn down the volume then you're not actually scaring anyone just making them jump. hiding isn't scary. running. that's scary, especially if he can catch up to you. i hope outlast is more substance rather than jumpscare.",0

"got it in the free weekend thingy, and i want my money back. first of all, if you have a gb graphics card such as an r or gtx etc. you can't put the graphics quality higher then medium-high. so the game looks utter crap, on cards which are capable of high or even ultra. the perks for a specialist is really unbalanced. someone will get a shot kill annihilator for no reason, other then that's their specialst perk. don't know if it's just for me or what, but the game crashed in the first mins of trying to play out of would get a new call of duty game again",0

"this is one of those rhythm games that should be on your 'i should play this game maybe' list. although the game seems simple not really , it isn't. the timing is the key here obviously, but timing for what? jumping? that isn't the only move you'll be doing here. anyways, the soundtrack is nice and it matches with the things you'll collect, like when you collect a pile of those bars, the music will also have something special at exactly that time. this is what makes this game even more enjoyable. the bars determine your score, so better collect 'em all. it would be more fun if you have people in your friend list that have played this game. you'd be more motivated to do the levels perfectly and beat their scores. all in all, this game is awesome and you should definitely try it out. lil' sucky gameplay to go with the review.",1

"just because a game is free does not mean it gets an automatic pass. this game is clearly just a vehicle for an extremely brief story. sadly the gameplay boils down to talking to some people, mixing a few drinks seriously? and making a final choice. there is hardly any story to speak of and the emotional and moral ideas the game seeks to convey are incredibly on the nose and shallow. even at maximum settings the graphics are atrocious. perhaps an artistic choice, but nevertheless still a sore sight.",0

"while my 'hours played' may seem decisively miniscule though they were actually just reset this game has improved so much over the course of its lifetime. it started out as simply a terraria clone where we weren't limited to a single planet, then slowly began to add more and more to its planets and civilizations. then, during its darkest period, the community and chucklefish began to become estranged. the game began to drag on, like another one of those early access projects that would never be completed. but, as we can see, they are finally past that state. this game is one of the very few games that i believe can make a personal connection with people. if you are at least considering buying starbound, just buy it.",1
"yes, i liked it. thought it is far from the glorious days of lucasarts adventures, it has its moments. puzzles are good, not too far fetched, and therefore solvable. voice acting is pretty good, art is stunning and the story is pretty well too. my only issue was with the episode format, because episode two took its sweet time i utterly forgot what happened in epsiode one and so had some issues of getting it on in episode two. anyway, if you like adventure games, i recommend this.",1

"this is one of those odd indie games that leaves you looking for hidden meanings and wondering what it was all about at the end. the style was neat and the music is excellent, and the tone is a little off-beat just when it seems to be getting 'in character', it throws some contemporary language in to mix you up. the gameplay elements based on the current real-time lunar phase was a neat mix. the one caveat i would add is that combat can be challenging there isn't a lot of combat overall it's mostly a puzzle game , but combat does require some good timing and was harder than i was expecting from an otherwise casual game. if you enjoy puzzle games, i'd definitely recommend trying superbrothers sword amp sworcery ep, especially if you can catch it on sale.",1

"nostalgic, topical, painful, heart-felt..this game had me hoping there would be closure for my companions and that though this is just a fantasy game, there are comparisons to real-life racism, anomie, and conflict. sometimes there is an obvious moral high ground, many times there is no right or wrong choice. will you choose to to be emotional, benevolant, rational, or cruel in your dealings. your attitude will create a reputation that follows you in the game. while i have not completed this game at the time of this review, i have a foreboding sense that the ending will be pyrrhic.",1

"the only real improvement over the original arma is that there are slightly less bugs. otherwise, it still has the same bad or broken mechanics, slow cumbersome interface, bad singleplayer campaign, and inconsistent or cheating ai my favourite ai tanks that seem to wall hack you . the only reason to ever play arma is because it is more realistic than other series like battlefield, and it mostly is, but some parts are not realistic at all, which creates a bad bipolar mixture. the dlc campaigns are marginally better but far too short. sadly, the arma series can still feel more like a good tech-demo than a properly polished game. if only arma's scale and realism were combined with battlefield's accessibility and polish, it would be amazing.",0

"i have played the left dead game for years, and still play, it is such a fun pick up and play game, and its re-playability is second to none. if? this is meant to have stolen its crown, then it has turned up at the wrong vault. this has nowhere near the staying power of left dead. the playable characters are not as fun. the setting is not as fun. the enemies are very lack lustre, bordering on the boring. the ai is some of the worst i have seen it makes this game look as though it was programed years before left dead. left dead has proven itself as a commercial worldwide game, this young pretender seems as though its running in the wrong race. it s not a bad game but very mediocre, i will play it from time to time.",0
"great game! lots of fun alone or with friends, can sometimes get frustrating matchmaking isnt quite refined yet but other than that a lovely game!",1
i highly recommend this game and series. it is truly a phenomenal series for those who like games that value tactics over micromanagement.,1

alrigth so you wanna know if this game is worth bucks? or if its on sale? pro's amazing gunplay fps always even on a laptop like mine idk? i dono what to say? cons -gets repeatitive really fast but not old -umm no more new objectives -no new escape styles people thought there would be more escapes in golden grin and umm yea! basically you should buy the game i say its worth it but read other reviews and do what ya need to do d,1
"worth, very very fun with friends, just very fun otherwise.",1
"this game barely gets a thumbs up from be mainly because its a new concept, nice art, nice music etc. . the biggest problem is that the game is based on luck. no matter how good you are at the game, you always depend on luck to constantly find planets with enough fuel, iron and oxygen. just be prepared to get frustrated a lot. for example even though you captured an amazing new ship, spent a lot of time discovering new technology, collecting the rare resources to build tech upgrades etc. etc. and then, bam, a random event makes you lose half of your fuel, and you end up in a solar system without any gas planets. game over in two turns, and nothing you could do about it. this happens a lot! unfortunately, the devs don't wanna hear anything about it. check the forums, they wanna keep this game a game of chance, to somehow show you the 'thoughness' of space travel or whatever. i think its sad, the game could be so much better and more skill based.. i hope modders will fix it, like it happened with ftl.",1
i am conflicted about this game on one hand it is fun but on the other there are alot of issues i have with the game. i am too lazy to write them all down so i'll sum it up as the game has a lot on the surface that you can do but they're all hollow on the inside. after and a half hours which is enough time to get a billion dollars you just feel how much is still missing from the game. i still recommend the game though because it scratches that tycoon itch. a real plus is the developers are constantly updating the game so new content does come out. its just not enough at the moment.,1
of this game is waiting to play it. all of the the minutes i have in this game was me waiting to get in a game out of,0
should have checked reviews before getting this game. basically lacks everything in any type of survival game.,0
"i really don't understand the hype behind this game. there really isn't any content to it, and what is there isn't much fun at all. some may say it is relaxing, but, to me, the game is just boring.",0
"in the beginning payday was a really great game, one of my favourites. the developers released free content and they listened to the community, for example they brought back a beloved character from the first payday. the first dlcs were also good and they were in balance with the free content. but then they startet to put out growing amounts of character and weaponpacks which became more and more ridiculous i like chivalry, but medieval weapons and heisting, honestly? overkill destroyed the original atmosphere of professional heisters and the charme the original crew had. the end of my payday career was the release of the microtransaction thing, although they said something like this would never happen. and on top of that the microtransactions are not only for cosmetica they boost your weapons performance. i really loved the game, but i will not support this anymore.",0
"runs like a turtle. developers always have their heads up their asses and dont listen to advice from their fanbase. when the game doesnt start, they add another update that makes the game slower. i have and always will love this game but overill needs to get their together before i even decide to play this game again. to new players, be cauitous before you play this broken game run by a bunch of greddy sweedish men.",0

at least these devs know how to live up to the years of hype they've created and not release a buggy piece of crap that's unplayable.,1
hate the first part so bad. i only bought lucius ii so i could say how much i hate it here. and no it wasnt even on sale but you just need to know how bad this game is!,0

it does not let me open it and i wen't to support and it still did not help at all still does not work at all,0
well this game is just amazing fun. i saw this on lirik's stream and fell in love with it. the soundtrack is outstanding and very relaxing. i recommend picking up the deluxe edition that comes with the soundtrack. the game has very chill to moments of pure stress micromanaging your painters. for people that like to decorate there is quite a bit you can do with that in here as well however going for your favorite textures furniture may cost you some prestige and draw in the poor folk. you will see some familiar names in here as well! very cool. i had fun pretending i knew anything about histrory. best part about this game for me is there are a lot of games similar to painters guild that are micromanagement and once youre done youre done. painters guild has cities as of right now of where you can expand your guild that all reward your work in different ways! so the replay value is actually pretty high!! i absolutely recommend you check this game out.,1
"over the past year and a half of regular updates i've seen this game get mesurably worse culmanating in the addition of microtransactions hyped as a 'free' 'reward' for the community. weapon balance is still broken probably even more so now after the t reblance, the safehouse is still useless, the ui actually got worse, server filter is a nightmare to use, damage notifications are often misleading, and being unable to join public games for no reason is fairly common still. oh yeah the recent dlcs have been garbage. weapon pack after weapon pack, a couple of boring hiests, and some eurotrash . glad to see some payday maps in the game, but the last good update was hoxton- a full year ago. tl dr if i could play the game the way it was a year ago i would. as is it's pretty mah.",0
"i could not find the steering wheel. so this must be the most stupidly designed game ever. i'd fire the programmers. no wonder it is free to play! looks potentially good, but controls. sorry i play total war and some really complicated games, but if you cannot do the basics then i won't be playing this. marks out of zero.",0
"i played a lot of this game. the experience was fun, i thought the game was really well made. my gripes are that the art for some of the characters were pretty bad, it didn't look natural. and the fact that almost any of the choices you make do not, in a lot of ways, change the ending as far as i know.",0

"a surpsingly enjoyable game, from what i have played. i just recieved this game with a free key, but it was worth my time. will play again soon.",1
frankly the game is lacking almost everything that was promissed. at this stage no man's sky is little more then a tech demo proof of concept.,0
the dedication for the servers is more like 'oh here is a potato.' 'yeah shut work!',0
"this game has horrible toilets. first off, apparently in every building in this game, the toilets bathtubs are hooked up to the ventilation systems. that can't be sanitary. second off, i can travel through said vents and toilets, and if anyone's sitting on the toilet and flush , then.. eau de toilette! all the points go to anyone who gets that joke. toilets plumbing was ok.",1
"really want to like this game as it seems to do everything right..besides being fun. the stat decay is insane and turns punch club into a chore as opposed to an entertaining experience. if they ever patched this, i'd love to give it another go but in it's current state, it's unplayable.",0

"not worth . or . for that matter. there isn't enough content with the base game that makes this game worth that price. content wise you will quickly discover to make this game very enjoyable you will need to download mods. unfortunately the web service that is being used to download upload mods to is just plain crappy from the ads to the annoying spam that says upgrade now for only . a month. game can be fun and enjoyable but requires a fair bit of mods to modify the core gameplay. overall its just not enough base content to justify the price of . and the hassle of downloading and installing mods from a crappy web service does not help. ksp's decision to not include steam workshop will make downloading any mod a chore. final verdict, not worth its price, wait for it to go on sale for . out of .",0

"i am a longtime fan of the total war series and nearly never miss a game release. i enjoyed this game though the departure from the army system is a bit of a shock when you first begin playing and can re-add some of the games learning curve which you might have thought you d worked out with other titles. the graphics and everything are excellent, and it s good to be back to exploring this point in time once more! for any players of the total war series i would suggest this game as a new and refreshing look into the games army management system.",1
"once you play it, you just cant stop! the levels that are coming out because of the . update keep you busy for hours, this is a fun and challenging game everyone can enjoy.. unless of course your are prone to some epilepsy..",1
"simply put, this game will not run on my well above reccomended specs computer. fx , gtx black screen on launch no matter what i try and i have spent days scouring google for a fix or work around.. all i found was thousands of people being ignored by the devs with the exact same problem, they don't want to help. if you buy this game it seems its a out of weather or not it will work for you at all, and even if you can get it to work eventually, it may not be woth the frustration also this game goes for elsewhere",0
"steredenn is almost certainly the best shmup i've played in many years. with procedurally-generated levels, a heap of weapons and upgrades, a reasonably-high degree of difficulty without being absolutely absurd , steredenn will keep you coming back for more and more and more. the pixel-art graphics are lovely, and the metal soundtrack suits the gameplay perfectly. play it. love it. die. repeat.",1

really dissapointed with this game. all of the servers dont work eu the character movements and physics are rubbish or at least need to look smoother and realistic like instead of a ken barbie manakin running sideways! they have still not created skin colour selection yet my character has a white persons head and a black persons body!! i cant even be bothered to rate it apart from say if you have any other zombie game stick with that as this needs alot of updates before i can even take it seriously.. still glad i didnt by it for .,0

"interesting concept but it's just so fiddly. i'm sure that's the point, but i felt like the interface got in the way substantially more than the actual tedium that they're trying to simulate. i found myself getting more and more frustrated with the game, and even knowing there's a deeper story, i just couldn't stick with it long enough to get over the interface troubles.",0
"i'm sure that this is probably a good game, as i liked the dark souls series. but omfg i have never been so off with the problems in a game. every single time i open the game, without fail, when it gets to the point that it darkens and goes to open the menu, it freezes completely and makes it so i have to log out of my user to be able to use my computer. i was looking forward to playing this, but with all the problems i am wondering if i should even put the effort into finding a fix if the tens of fixes i've tried already dont work. massive dissapointment.",0
don't buy this game.you can play this game on a web browser for free!,0
sounds are terrible. you can't feel the combat. it's like swinging your sword in the air. i recommend kingdoms rise. it's on alpha and buggy but u can feel when you hit also fighting techniques are great. if you like just spamming left mouse button i really recommend you panzar.,0
"graphics are mediocre at best with low framerate. view distance is a joke. action animations are cutting edge for a game that came out years ago. if you like wandering around for hours picking up garbage, then this game is for you.",0

i married a chest out of would marry a chest again,1
how did i take so long to recommend this!?,1
"the game was of a mediocre kind of dungeons and dragons skyrim sort of minecraft knock-off, but it was fairly on the better side of knock-offs, but that's also one of many reasons why i'm giving it a bad review. the game itself is fairly fun, minus the ungodly amount of lag, and all the in-app purchases keeping you from having too much fun. now i will talk about the controls. if it were for ios, or android, i would have let this go, but the 'controls' barely controlled anything, much less everything. personally, i'm not very biased against knock-off f p games, but it was just too impossible to play without the egregious amount of iaps, and without a solid controller option. all in all, i'd give this game a out of , and would recommend nearly any game over this virtually unplayable game without hackers and there are plenty of those . out of with hackers",0
"maybe good game for someone, but not for me..",0
"the game is very linear, requiring the player to follow a trail of green moss through a 'lifeless planet'. since the planet is lifeless, most of what you find are rocks, rocks, and well, rocks. you will have to push the rocks around, jump from rock to rock, and sometimes you will find yourself trapped inside a rock! finishing the game with a fair amount of exploration takes about hours. around . of those hours will be spent walking between 'puzzles', hour will be spent walking back to the puzzle that you didn't quite make the next ledge so you died and went back to a checkpoint, and about . hours will be spent actually working through the puzzles. these 'puzzles' are nearly always just platforming with one exception near the end of the game . this game has a simple story that advances through the game, but provides the player with a somewhat hopeless ending if months are weeks and centuries may have passed, would someone be kept on life support for s of years? overall, about out of stars. would not recommend the game.",0

nothing is true. everything is permitted.,1
probably the best third person shooter on the market. it's faster pased than tf with all of the running and rolling and grenade. but at the same time they are very similiar. they are both masterfully constructed games that are well balanced and give you plenty of weapon choices. if you like tf but always wanted it to have more free movement controls i definately reccomend this game.,1

"pay win game most of the classes are locked until i pay, game doesnt even have an in-game currency for people who dont want to pay win. free to play games that are pay win are like dog turds mistaken for chocolate, looks good at first, but when you find out what they are it makes you want to vomit tl dr - this game sucks.",0

"this game is a technical disaster, a mish-mash of artstyles and creative directions - and, well - the music is fine enough. from the starting tutorial, it feels nearly impossible to 'get a feel' for the controls, and after hours of playtime - i'm still constantly baffled by this game's technical choices. it's quite obvious the game's technical director told the development team to keep adding in graphical improvements, and more, and more - to the point where it is literally unplayable in.. well, most areas. the controls and gameplay will have you wondering what direction you're going to be firing your weapon or swinging your sword - and often leave you open to the quite difficult enemy's attacks. with a.. what.. year old rig with fairly upgraded parts, decent amount of ram and a minimalistic set of processes - i can't get this game above fps nearly anywhere. and in most parts it is far worse, with paralaxing backgrounds and rain effects in addition to all the lighting and particle effects that put the game in its currently nearly unplayable state. don't buy, don't rent. go grab terraria and have some fun with your life d",0

"it's a standalone expansion. it's not very entertaining if this is your first entry into the sr series. i feel that this game was made as a stand alone because primarily to aoid allowing another 'season pass ' allowing players to skimp on . secondarily the change in appearance. the controls have lost sensitivity from sr to this game, as aiming is far worse. sr was the fall, sr was the crash, and this game is the attempted 'band-aid' cash. most likely to try to make a salvageable sr . i'd say buy it for the hopes of a better sr, but don't buy it b c this is the worst installment.",0

"i played this game as freeware back when it first got translated into english, and i've always enjoyed the other miscreant's room games, so i figured i'd go ahead and put my money where my thanks was. the gameplay hasn't changed much, as far as i can remember. i guess you could go to the translator's website and play basically the same game for free, but it's worth it to support sen. pros about this game it's a horror game with only a few jumpscares, and most of those are very mild the sound design can be really annoying at times. aya's scream in particular sounds more like somebody stole her cupcake and less like she got murdered by sentient dolls. even when the scream was part of a cutscene, my sister would look up from across the room and say, did you die again? the father isn't really mad. he seems quite happy, in fact. and if you try to tell me he's 'mad' in that he is insane, i'd have to say no, he really isn't. he has no mental illness. he is just an a hole.",1
"don't buy this on steam! it's full of bugs, the graphics aren't good or fluid as the original version of the game and it keeps crashing! don't expect anything as the devs are busy working on something else than fail portings. if you do like abe, try oddysee or exoddus here on steam instead!",0
"in regards to this review, i'm not a proper critic and do not base your opinion on this review. being a longtime fan of sid meier's civilization series sid meier s civilization vi did not disappoint. this title in the series has probably played the best and renewed my enjoyment in the series. it brings me back to sid meier s civilization iv where it improved upon every aspect of its predecessor and i had alot of fun and enjoyment with iv and like iv sid meier s civilization v did that same thing an improvement of engine gameplay and etc but with v came alot of unpleasent bugs that took years to get it to the mostly playable state that it is in now. what is different about vi that distinguishes it from its predecessors and why do i think its entitled to being the best of the series? pros",1
this game has a amazing story and back story to the bioshock series i had fun playing this game the entire time never stopped.,1
"dumbass piece of . worthless. controls are horrendous, graphics suck, it's repetitive as all hell, and whoever made this put in just enough effort to con poor, bored saps out of their well-earned quid.",0
this game is good. if you are not destroyed always after hours. so it is a piece of garbage. you should rethink the whole game noobs! it is an annoying game! even the most advanced players will fail. that is right. that is what you wanted? instead of enjoying the game? then you got it. yes you got a delete for euro!,0

"for i've found a lot more staying power in many other games than nidhogg. i have yet to see any visible additions to the game let alone updates to gameplay. it is a gimmicky game to me that i would play with a friend on occasion and nothing more. latency creates huge issues. having said that, my advice to playing this game losing your sword and chasing your opponent to the end of the stage is pointless run in the opposite direction and commit sudoku so that you can spawn faster. thrusting and parrying mechanics are lost on any casual player. throw your sword, jump over your opponent, roll under them or karate kick them from above. those are your options. once you lose your sword, karate kick or sudoku. did you win? congrats, get eaten. repeat. on one of four levels.",0
"this game is amazing! i have played hours and hours of it, and even though the perma-death function is a little annoying i still come back to it every time, and still have fun. the new owner, deca has done an amazing job already and i see a very bright future with a game that was once dying. i highly recommend this game to anyone, as you can pick it up or put it down at any time.",1
stay away. game is not working and devs keep feeding you the empty promises.,0
"it's not balanced well, you just can't beat some imba levels. not worth the money.",0
simple but addictive fun. i got this game in the sales and haven't bothered playing any of the others i got yet! it is just too good to stop.,1
this game and the original are great. but absolutely annoying due to the fact they're barely optimized and run like on amd. it seems to be using some sort of nvidia gimpworks because i can't get this thing to play at anything i deem playable. it's laughable. the nvidia party is trying to monopolize gaming while amd open sources everything to help the consumers..i hope vulkan takes over the industry. i will never buy nvidia again.,0

"i made it about two minutes in before quitting for good. the writing is an absolute mess - it's like it hasn't even had an editor look at it. the tense randomly changes between sentences, the prose is purple, and it's just.. so.. frustrating.. to read. i'm sure the story is nice, right? i'd love to learn more about the setting. but i can't get past the writing.",0
"cant play with my friends, game gets stuck in midddle of a game also, graphic bug, no sound when alt tab, no teamchat ..",0
"nice casual puzzle game. players have to convey the electricity ball to chip using circuits. on circuits are some or many tricks you have to struggle with. the sooner the better, the fewer movements also the better. it has a bit cheap graphic, but i could feel the dev's goodwil to make players have fun. you can purchase costumes which chip will put on as game progresses. let alone the puzzle is fun to solve.",1

this game isn't very clear on its controles. it can get very frustrating. also for some reason there will be times where your fps can jump from to like for no reason.,0
they should have put more time in to the game and they should t have put dinos just for the nazes,0
i shouldn't have bought this and neither should you. edit guess what? disabling the minimap gives you - fps boost. do you still want to buy this shoddy port?,0
this game reminds me very much of the dungeon keeper games. it is very entertaining to play however it has many coding problems that still need to be resolved. it most definitely has horrible memory leaks in the code. there have been several patches already to resolve issues with the memory issues and gameplay lag. i would say this game will reach a stable patch state in late may into early june.,1
"i got this game during a dark period in my life, i swear.",1
"a promising game once again spoilt by total idiots spawn killing 'camping near safe points ready to shoot any new player who spawns in and tries to complete tutorial ,which in itself is a joke it does not tell you anyhing about the game what so ever' . game itself is good if there were pve server's would definetly recommend as the mechanics are realy nice as it is though i would avoid if you get frustrated by pay to win players killing anything that moves. don't believe the freindly crap either all in all just another dayz. good game just bad players f ing up this game. if you are one of these please idiots go back to fps games and leave these type of games to people that actually want to play a game of skill and survival rather than pay a fortune to get realy good equipment then shoot everyone on sight.",0
"i heard of this game on rock paper shotgun, and the concept intrigued me. after picking it up, i found it to be a really enjoyable game, full of atmosphere and clever design. i wasn't aware of the action combat elements, however, and could have done without them. but it still was an excellent game nonetheless! looking forward to seeing more from over the moon.",1
this seems like a nice relaxing game and i think it can be but for now i want to play something and it looked like you could do things based on the store page. when i started a new game i had a tree and a rock. i wasn't able to do much and didn't know what i was actually able or supposed to do. maybe a faster version with a tutorial would help me understand more but until then i'm going to have to suggest not buying it. check out the discussion section of the community page for a guide on how to play this game. it kinda helps but not really. i like the concept of casual games that you can relax with and enjoy but there is no instruction in this game to let you know how to do things or what you're supposed to do. i feel like the intent that the developer wants to get accross is a relaxing and zen like garden game but it gets lost with it's lack of in game guidance.,0
"if your thinking of buying dark souls, you better be ready for most likely a rage filled playthrough, some from this game being not optimized for pc i recommend getting the dsfix mod to essentially fix the games problems or just that the game being just to difficult. one thing though is certain. you will love this game for what it is.",1
"ps version biggest plus of is story, beautiful and detailed city, and driving shooting system. ofc. there is alot of secrets like pedestrians talking in polish , i also found some epic music through radio stations. multiplayer is weak, but servers are empty anyway . i had loot of fun with this game!",1
either log in to uplay or we won't let you play the game you paid for. well done ubisoft!,0
"call of duty ghosts is a bit of an identity crisis. it wants to be a modern warfare game, but it also wants to be something completely different. if you like modern warfare, you'll find some enjoyment out of it, but if your not a huge call of duty person or wondering if you should jump back in with this game, keep looking elsewhere. the campaign is short and unsatisfying, multiplayer is barely worth playing, and extinction feels differnt enough from treyarch's zombies that it's worth playing. just a decent mediocre entry in this aging beast. out of overall.",0
it says it has full controller support but it doesnt my dualshock controller doesnt work with it.,0

"personally speaking i wouldn't buy this game. the graphics are extremely slopped together and honestly, i didn't expect that at all. on top of that, you need to download a mod just to shoot and aim straight and to use widescreen. if you don't want your childhood ruined, i highly recommend avoiding this game.",0

"do not buy this game or any k game for that matter unless you plan to buy them every year. server support was dropped for this game with no warning. my player that i spent hours trying to max out is now gone. i was going to play a lot over new year's holiday, only to be met with the message that i could not connect to the online servers. if you search around, this is not an uncommon problem to have due to crummy support, but then found a tweet from their ksupport 'reminding us' that the nba k servers will be discontinued after today. therefore, this game is now trash. it was pretty fun to play, but it would be a complete waste of money now, even on sale. proof",0

"unfortunately, the game becomes unplayable on windows due to constant crashes. i would love to play more of it because for the few minutes that i was able to play it between crashes, it was extremely fun. this negative review comes more from my disappointment of not being able to play what is probably another awesome vlambeer game than from the game not being good because it genuienely seems something i would really enjoy.",0
"what an atrocity.. fear and were absolutely fantastic games that were unrivaled in the fusion of horror and fps, and still are, to this day. eventually fear came along to complete the trilogy. fear had atmosphere, difficulty, great story and great gameplay. fear had more of the same, but with a more streamlined approach to the story, but it didn't have as many open ended levels. fear ditched the horror, the good writing and ended up adding coop to follow the coop craze. the game was not difficult, the horror elements were completely removed, and the story was so out of wack, incongruent and just horribly written. both the first fear games had incredible ai that provided difficulty. here, they might as well just be standing still. the level design is horribly linear, with no options of going in a different way. do yourselves a favor and stay away from this atrocity. if you were a fan of the first games, this game will do nothing but sour your memory of the series. avoid this like the plague!",0
non-sensical and utterly unrealistic competitive shooter that ballooned to notoriety off the back of the war on terror. conspicuous absence of out of lore makes this valve classic one to avoid.,0

"basically it was a pretty ing awesome game, get a good crew and sweet. play for a few weeks quite happily. after paying for all the dlc. and now they want us to pay for skins? so. we payed quite a bit as a community, i payed around just for dlc it seems and now i have to pay for this ?! how bout no thanks.",0
while i can sympathize with fans of sacred amp for not being more of the same or building from those blocks i think the 'overwhelming negative' review its getting is misleading on the game itself . had they changed the name to something else.. the way they did with citadels their golden axe style game .. i think wouldnt have off its fans so much. if you are just looking for something along the lines of gauntlet or smash tv this is decent if u can get it for a few buck. if you are looking for the more diablo like game of -.. then you might want to skip this one.,1
"dragon's dogma dark arisen is as close to an hd remaster of the original xbox and ps game as you can get. buttery smooth fps that doesn't seem to waiver, great combat, upgrades and item crafting make this a great game for anyone who is a fan of action rpgs in the vein of fable or dark souls. from the open world teeming with life, to the random battles and the epic boss fights this game delivers on all fronts. dragon's dogma dark arisen is definately worth a buy. a great deal for and a steal at , get your hands on this if you're an rpg fan!",1

unless you want to play with a console controller don't purchase this title. i am not able to remap all the keys and will not be able to play the game. i have spent my money but will not be able to play. also strange for a pc gamer.. the walk backward key causes the character to turn around and walk in the oppisite diretion instead of back peddaling. the console dna of this game has made this game unplayable for a mouse and keyboard gamer like me. a shame as it and its follow-on phantom pain look very interesting. don't purchase if you are a keyboard and mouse gamer!,0
"i really can not recommend this game to anyone. it's unfortunately pretty bad. the voice acting is terrible especially the character of silvia , the puzzle logic is sometimes pretty strange. maybe i'm just dumb but a few times i found myself having to just randomly try items on various objects to continue. and worst of all the plot is pretty nothing. i get that it's an episode , so it's mostly setup. but i would have liked for something to happen.",0
"the campaign quickly becomes boring and repetitive, and the multiplayer in my experience has many hackers or possibly lag from most players living around russia . on one occasion, i put a full round of mp ammo into another player in deathmatch, and they proceeded to snipe me at point blank without being scoped in. the only real way to have fun is to get a few friends who all have the game and play around on a closed server, which then becomes great fun. however, the game by itself is repetitive, boring, and in case of the multiplayer, frustrating.",0
"i played original kof on fightcade with a friend, i'm at it but it was fun for messing around so i bought the 'better' version with more characters and new stuff however it plays really laggy even with friend really close to me i live in italy and he's in france and the game showed ms and imput delay while in any other games we play just fine also it keep crashing in both online and practice mode making it virtually unplayable do not waste your moneys, go play it on fightcade instead or buy kof",0
"the gameplay can be quite fun at times, but overall just ends up being a twitch shooter. i would definitely recommend this game if it weren't for the ludicrous spawns in freeforall and team deathmatch. spawns in tdm are set at a single point which everyone knows in the map. why not just switch spawns around when closed in? lazy game made by lazy developers.",0
"interesting to say the least. the story and gameplay, although leaving you constantly scratching your head, is pretty good. i was constantly just clicking on things, hoping that it would let me advance throught the story however. i am not sure if i would recommend it, but it is a free game so there is no loss for you if you did not enjoy it well, apart from time . i have given a thumbs up just because it is free to be fair. the game's sort of cliffhanger ending is alright, although it did not leave me contemplating anything unlike other reviews promised. overall, the gameplay story is good. out of",1
"biggest let-down of the year. everything in this game is just boring, i don't understand how other people enjoy it, when half of the game is just trailing missions. cons- -trailing missions -deathclaws and radscorpions coming out of nowhere and killing you -boring gameplay -can't get a refund pros- -graphics -cool map i was extremely disappointed with this game, and hope they actually make it interesting in the next game. but for now, i refuse to buy any garbage from bethesda.",0

"this game is one of the best experiences i've ever had with a video game. take my word. it will blow your mind. the way the controls blends in with the narrative is ingenious, and it will make you wonder why there isn't more developers doing this already. the gameplay is simple, but stellar. controlling both brothers feels awkward at first, but after the introductory level it feels more natural and easier. the art style is also amazing. stylized, and highly evocative throughout the whole game. setpiece after setpiece will make your jaw drop. the music is impressive aswell. to conclude buy the damn game.",1
way too flashy and expensive.,0

"this game is a lot of fun! it definitely toes the line of what i'm comfortable playing, because you shooting a bunch of cops and stupid innocent bystanders in the process. still, for a prude like me it's fantastical enough that i'm able to look past that. sometimes. gameplay is very challenging, which i like. it takes some planning, some familiarity with the map, and a whole lot of teamwork to make things go semi-smoothly. the graphics are really top-notch and the controls fairly intuitive - some of it took a little getting used to. skill selection isn't really explained in the game so look up a video on youtube so you know what you need to do - once you get it down it's easy enough. definitely worth the , or get some friends together and go in on a -pack. if you enjoy fps co-op games like left dead, borderlands or dead island, you'll enjoy this game.",1

"sooo many issues, for starters, the game is a chore just finding out that it is very incompatible. played deus ex , no problems, but this game is a freaking checklist of things you have to do just to get it too run. on top of that, this game has an excessive amount of bugs, resolution difficulties, lots of loading screen. cannot blow open doors anymore, all the guns use the same ammo which gives no strategy that you had in the first game. all the levels are very linear and small, just a series of going back and forth in the same level. this game took everything fun in the first game limited free roam, rpg elements and threw it away. story is dumb also, you never care about anyone",0
excellent gameplay and characters. good hardcore missions and epic skills and weapons. this game is the beginning of a new generation of gaming.,1
"used a giant to punch an ocean in mountains other neat crap. made people, made said people war eachother, then smote the people i did not like. people from remaining villiage became ignant, so i smote them too. made new people, accidently made wayyyy to many people, used mountain giant to cause earthquake and quelled population. still playing.. going to get people to attack me and then smite them again.",1
"if you're thinking of buying this game don't, just pirate the yose it's literally the same game except with the bug fixes and patches they should have done for this game sure it's a good game it's everything i've ever wanted in a zombie survival except it's filled with bugs and the developers are lazy asshats that have the decency to leave the normal one as is despite it's apparent flaws and known bugs and fix all these problems and release as a 'new' ing game and then they try to charge for it you've got to be ing joking so yeah just pirate this peace of it's the developers fault for being in idiots",0

just another game by trion.,0
"enjoyed at first and early on, but then kinda forced myself to finish the game to get all the achievements. took me about hours pros - nice artwork and lore - the 'find the hidden objects' and 'spot the differences' puzzles are great cons - no resolution adjustment - gets really repetitive and boring later on",0

"while the port needs a few more improvements such as audio sliders, it's honestly worth the purchase. microtransactions have been converted to use in game cash, steam multiplayer works great other than the fact that sometimes my friend crashes, but that seems to be on his end , and it's still the crazy fun game you remember from your phone. out of",1

"when i first clicked on this game, i was very skeptical on the product itself. little did i expect a game of such caliber that would lead to moving me to such a high and intense level. let's say i smiled a little less, my eyes were a little wetter, and i was in awe by the time i finished the game. the storyline was complex on a simple level. the music alone was a magnificent component and made the gameplay much more epic than expected. out of would recommend and play again.",1
"classic game that i can play over and over again, its addicting",1
pretty good game but the game engine is,1
i can't play more. the combat is not fun. the caracters are annoying. not recommended.,0
this game has about as much depth as a puddle and the ai is frustratingly bad a death sentence for management games . normally i would put more time into a game before writing a review but there really is not much to see here. the steam score this game has is completely unjustified.,0
"for myself, long loading times are a deal breaker for games. i can't immerse myself when i'm constanly staring at loading screens. this game not only has very long loads - sec between areas but has so many areas, and one is constantly required to move repeatedly amongst them ie. defiance bay and buildings in every town . i find myself staring at loading screens or tv sometimes longer than actually playing. and i have a high end gaming pc with a top of the line video card. for my wants, simply unplayable.",0
from what ive watched from youtube.. it looks like a good game only i cant play it. i have it every time i try to load it it gets stuck on creating group or what ever and ive had this for a while and it doesnt seem that they really give to sh ts about it sorry for the use of words but i waited a long time for this game and i cant even play it.. my friends tell me how good it is and here i am sad. so i am going to not recommend this game only to save those who will buy it and then not be able to play it..,0

"good game, but the bugs and crashes are terrible. i have a good computer that exceeds the recommended requirements. however the game is full of crashes, you will crash in mid game. often times the game will start then crash right away over and over. my player mode is terrible in k , spike lee ruined it. he needs to understand that not everyone that loves basketball is from harlem with black twin sister. it makes no sense for my character to be any other race than black, if my twin sister is a black girl. it is not my player, its spike lee's player. can't even choose my own name, i have to be called freq freak all the time. character customization is terrible.",0

"its free and i like the story of the game, most of all i like that you dont need to spend tons of money for heroes and rewards in game are good, also the splinters are easy to grind for a new hero",1
"this 'game' is more like an interactive story. it's a certainly a compelling one, and i enjoyed watching it unfold. however, it takes less than hours to complete, so i don't think it justifies its current asking price.",1
i can't recommend this game. during beta i loved it. now after release this is a trainwreck. -unbalanced -poor performance especially on amd cards even above recommended specs -long queues with bad match making. -the new heroes that where supposed to be 'included free' with the aaa priced release game cost more than a free to play game hero to unlock with ingame currency. or pay win with dlc. -the cherry on top that led me to leave this review is the addition of microtransaction to sell the t skins everyone had been waiting for for real instead of ingame currency. -bad grindy rng for pve farming to gear up for pvp. -small amount of repetitive pve missions that you have to grind over and over. this game could have been amazing but its just a turd now. biggest let down of for me.,0
"this game doesn't work like i try to start the game and it doesn't want to,this game download had completely waste my time and i pay for this game. for now i don't recommend this game until yhis problem is fix, i want my money back please",0
you can't even change your resolution. edit well you can but you need to go to the .ini files and that is a pain in the . the game won't let you change the resolution directly on options.,0

"tactical intervention is a first person shooter type of game. it has similar ties to counter-strike since 'gooseman' was part of the team that developed counterstrike. pros - an idea of car chasing which is extremely buggy - has the same idea as counter-strike cons god forbid that this will not take the whole review - extremely buggy - contains the dreaded p w system pay win - the car chase is good at first, but gets down to hell buggy later - guns that are bought using in-game cash is temporary, however some are permanent but those are hella expensive. - first few minutes might be fine, but gets offbeat later and you get the feeling of the enemy's guns being op, considering you're not a p w player. - at rare times, a bug in the vip game mode gets extremely rediculous. as it switches the vip to another player. - the rappeling is not fun at all",0
"its basically a d version of eve, but without the boredom and complicated ui. ..or even think of it like a multiplayer version of space pirates and zombies, if you've played that. tons of ships, tons of stuff to put in the ships, hundreds of planets to explore and trade and hunt and pirate and get blown up and spending the first few hours of your life paying off the loan to the bank for your starter ship. npcs everywhere, doing thier own thing. my only gripes - - i'd like to see a mining system - i'd like to see a slightly more robust chat interface. people move too fast to click on and hail. also theres so many freaking ships its hard to tell who's human or npc. i've only sank a few hours into it, and i'm already in love. also its free and opensource. ..and only like mb. do it.",1
"hell yeah! finally i got my left dead original copy. i ever played this game before i got mine on steam. it is a zombie apocalypse game, but even though it is a zombie game, personally i never think this game was creepy as hell like other horror games do. let's just pick an example, outlast or amnesia the dark descent, which is really creepy and full of jump scares as hell. i love it, especially the online features. we can play with our friends just like we play cs-go. what make this a different from other horror game was this game is fps first person shooter which mean it is most likely looks like cs-go but with zombie apocalypse environment and lastly, i will give my personal rating for this game. . . . . . . . . . out of hooray! thanks valve for making this game really awesome!",1

"the sandbox stealth missions are fun. but i would not recommend this title at full price - the game was released with huge chunks of content cut. the story, whether you love or hate it, is as campy and zany as ever but it still suffers from content being cut with the story making huge jumps between plot points and leaving many unfinished. a lot of promise, but does not live up to it's hype. maybe worth picking up on sale.",0

"honestly, this game is hit or miss depending on your preferences. if you want a game where you can run around with an axe chopping things off, this is the game for you. however, the combat system does take some getting used to, or at least used to the fact that blocking does stuff. gloriously violent animations, good gamemodes, and a tounge in cheek attitude. bring out your heads.",1

great co-op experience. you might want to buy two copies of this one for yourself and one for your friend .,1
. for train . for a train and a map or rather 'train line' complete t dlc i don't even know why steam hasn't taken action against this game to either drop the prices down or remove it completely. if you value your sanity and want a good game with good dlc stay away from this game!!,0
"a great follow-up to the original f.e.a.r. the enemy design has improved, but boss encounters don't quite seem to fit with the story.",1
"the writing and references in borderlands are awful and takes priority over creating an enjoyable apocalyptic world with a large variety of weapons. the loot system can make or break your experience with this game, and chances are you will be on the receiving end of the unfair random number generator. borderlands 's practice of releasing downloading content and the way they handled the season pass is also unacceptable while gearbox's actions since have only escalated. i cannot recommend this game, or its prequel, at least telltale's adventure game does this series a service.",0
"nice! i didn't have high hopes, as it 'looked' too good to be any good, but this is a beautiful and fast paced, twitch space shooter with personality, lighting fast action, and a space setting and story that invoke the likes of homeworld and bsg. love it! and runs wonderfully in linux d a special note to the music and overall presentation, very nice.",1

not a fan of this game and would recommend people to buy t.e.c instead also cheaper if you like amp enjoy incredible speed and levels not designed to be unfair so go buy tec if you want a fun and good speed game! btw distance is also a great game worth to recommend. note the movement sensitivity are horrible in this game to say at least the movement are too slow in this game amp same time feels as you are sliding on jelly also when you flip then the screen have moved feets closer when you are done with the flip instant rekt why i do not want to waste time talking about this game,0

"a brilliant stand-alone game previously from the half life out of mod that is different from the rest of the first person shooters that have been recently released, mostly because of the fact it is a western first person shooter, there aren't many western first person shooters around. i bet that if you could name more than three gaben , you would be living in an alternate dimension, or be very old. the fact that it is liked so much from me, personally was because that even if there are funny glitches and bugs, this game has character, like, a charm, the current aaa firstperson shooters are more slick, and efficient, but boring, like the germans, aber, but, fistful of frags is a game where when you get that headshot with a bow and arrow and you're just like 'mom get dah camerah!' it's a high skill - high reward game, if you don't believe me, play it, and if that doesn't work for you, you can mothering die you sick son of a ing , rethink what you just said, and do it indefinitely when half-life comes out . thank you and goodbye",1
this game is reaally nice! i love to play it. it got a huge amount of horror and skill d but the lobby system sucks like hell. you can't actually play with friends except you have to play. this is bad. and the lobby hopping system doesn't work most of the time. sorry. waiting for patches,0
"first thing first, it's free for everyone who already owned the game. even if they own the physical version they can open a ticket with k and hopefully get a steam key for it. i'm getting a solid - fps in game. however - there's not anything noteworty with the graphical settings, you have resolution, af and aa and an 'fov extended mode' but not an actual fov slider and that's about it. no sliders for anything else",1

"to be honest with you guys, i'm not a person who is willing to give negative feedback, but in this case it really couldn't be anything else.. first of all, while playing this game you will not know what is happening around you. from the meaningless main menu, through cluttered levels, to ridiculous ways to die. it's really annoying not to have at least short description of characters or weapons to choose. i'm not saying it is not possible to play this game, but you have to be really stubborn person to keep doing it after a short while i don't recommend.",0
this is fun but several achievements are not working for me.,1

"the game play is good, and indepth. one of the only real mmorpgs left. the problem is it is percent pay win, and its a pvp game. you literally can buy everything in this game with real life cash, from top end characters, to money, to ships, everything in this game can be obtained with cash. so some one starting out, would have chance agaisnt the people who have been playing forever, or the starting player who dumps large sums of cash into the game. so if you think your gonna be on fair ground paying a sub, then you will be sorely mistaken. one of the worst pay win games i have even seen.",0

to much to big and to boring.,0
"i like this game, not as much as saints row the third, but a lot. the first thing you will notice is that the interface and the engine are facelifted, but not overhauled. this was a lot to deal with at first, since this game came out years later. the customization options are only very lightly expanded, and the guns are roughly the same, although with different models. the interface, despite it's facelift, still shows a controller-centric vew of gaming as well. but still, the game is very fun, and once you get itnot it, it's quite easy to lose track of time in this one.",1

bring back the old memories. multiplayers getting better. good games. lobby in the multiplayer need to improve though. can't chat in lobby.,1
"this game was probably good years ago but it's not anymore. the combat is basic and the ai is infuriating. but as it's an action game based around escorting people to a safe house, that's not a great combination. the save system is designed to give the game a rolling 'new game plus' mode in a sense, where each subsequent game carries over the skills stats of the previous combined playthroughs, however the overall affect is a sense that your time is being wasted. cant possibly recommend this, unless you played it on it's original release and loved it. and the controls are total even on a gamepad .",0
"this game is amazing and don't let the dlc scare you away. vanilla brings hundreds maybe thousands hours of gameplay, and with all the dlc it brings you up even higher. it was only people making it full time and right now only person is maintaining and making dlc full time. they sometimes bring in other people to work on small things but mostly on person at a time works on it. that is why there is a lot of dlc. just that it's almost years old and new content is still getting pushed out is a sign that this game is worth the price. i definitely recommend this to any rpg and or strategy fans. if you don't want to fight wars, then don't. if you want to be a tyrant then do it. possibilities are endless.",1
"this game really deserves your time, im not going to say anything else because you really need to just experience it for yourself. my only gripe would be the slow backtracking but even that isn't bad or very frequent. check this game out it is worth the purchase.",1
"ubi soft once again redefining something to maximize profit. buy the season pass, and then still buy dlc's because we can milk you for more. beware ubi soft, first uplay is so damn unstable it keeps crapping out, and now this practice are gonna bite you in the a if you keep it up. okay, ubisoft have relented and added final frontiers as part of the season pass, so hats off for that. still going to stay as a negative review for them trying to pull that stunt in the first place. if it had'nt been for such an uproar from the community they would have happily pocketed the cash, and thought 'hum, another way to milk the fans'.",0

"about this game.. well, as it is written, is some kind of atmospheric story. it has nice graphics, good player-game environment, nice voice actors, good background music and sounds.. but yes, there is a 'but' the game is absolutely straightforward. ----- spoilers ahead ----- there is practically nothing else to do than walk run towards the next objective. there are no dangers lurking around.. there is nothing in there besides you. i'm not sure if i'll ever install it again, and i'm a little sad that it took me hours to complete the game making steam's refund policy unavailable for me . at least it is not an expensive game and you can see the detailing and effort placed by the devs in every mouse turn. still, i'm quite dissapointed. i expected a little more. recomendation get murdered soul suspect instead. g'luck folks!",0

"smrpg feels broken and patchy. i can't recommend it, the on screen elements are very abrasive and the movement is finicky. the ui is awful - won't stay set to gamepad controls displayed, so i constantly had no idea which button to press. the 'folder' is difficult to navigate and the game elements attacks, boosts, etc are never really explained, which left me just equipping and buying and spamming things all over the place. the stats are not explained or really referenced anywhere so i was left applying miscellaneous boosts that might have had an impact. with a couple of improvements or indeed an overhaul of the menu folder system and a bit more indication for what to use, the game might be playable, but it would need many more changes for me to recommend it.",0
"i left a longer review on the newer version of this game, world basketball tycoon or wbm tycoon , which i still didn't recommend it looks a bit nicer and has some other fun features and less bugs but still no tutorial. this one is absolutely obtuse, no tutorial, worse ui, and best of all keeps crashing on me or bugging out. sorry, nope.",0

"its okay. that a problem. a video game should not be 'okay'. it should be fantastic. especially with a aaa studio. the gameplay is fun, as long as you've got some friends to play with. however, the game is a grind to get weapons and stuff. you can literally do a mission over an over again, just to get a f---ing attachment for your weapon. the gameplay is slightly repetitive, especially as i said above when grinding. stealth is usually not an option, so thats also a downside. it does have it's ups, though. combat feels quite exciting. there's several ways to perform and execute the heist. if you have a bunch of money and a bunch of friends, i'd buy this. just don't be surprised if you find yourself bored within a couple hours.",1

"the best way to describe rainbow six siege to someone is to compare it to csgo because rainbow six siege is a better version of csgo. why is it a better version of csgo you might be asking yourself? because rainbow six siege is csgo with destructible maps, more characters, more weapon customization, more tacticle and real gun play, and a co-op and multiplayer mode. in rainbow six siege cover is your best way to stay alive but your cover can also be destroyed so your always on the move. - shots will kill you depending on the weapon your enemy is using. bullet about damage i think and you only have health but your team mates can revive you if they get to you fast enough but you can increase the time you have to be revived by trying to decrease the blood your loosing. honestly im enjoying rainbow six siege so far and i've gotten alot of fun from this game. at the time i'm uploading this review i'd have to give rainbow six siege a out of because the attention to detail is amazing, the gameplay is even better, and i love games with destructible maps",1

"you know when you're playing old school rts games such as warcraft or age of empires and you think to yourself, 'this game would be much better if..' now for me the blank space is 'could build a giant kingdom and traverse it' this game does just that and add's an mmo aspect to it. deffinatly recomend this game! the first hour of it is kind of a grind but after that hour every thing just seems so epic and awesome!",1
its a good reality check.. most of the time you think when will this thin end but how it ended i thought to myself this is ed up im like drowning in tears i thought the whole time she was like an actual person i should have know with a name like ai,1

"not my kind of game at all. no real tutorial whatsoever which makes it confusing before you even start. the music is repetitive and awful, and the game itself is just so slow and boring. the only good thing i can say about this game is that i got it mega cheap and the artwork in the game is good. if i'd have paid more than a couple of pounds for this game, i'd have been very disappointed. . out of",0
really cheap deaths. very frustrating. out of,0
"while i applaud the traffic simulation my two concerns with the game is the lack of reality to real city building and a minimal difference with the simcity series. i'm coming from an urban planning background and being able to bulldoze whatever you want instantly is a little annoying and the shallow depth of 'zoning' doesn't help. factory to warehouse to store is a product chain i'd like to see. to that end, i see this game as a remastering of simcity with minimal additions to the city building adventure.",0
got forced to by the game,1
"one of the most visually satisfying and realistically creative games i have ever had the pleasure of expirencing. i can't vouch for , but with last light you have a guaranteee, an unforgettable expirence.",1
pretty much the same as mnc but with a talking monkey in a suit in it.,1
i'm not sure if im gonna complete it ever.,1
i really like this game. looks great and awesome gameplay.,1
"so yeah, after hours of payday and countless of dlc's which bring nothing really innovative to the game and especially after the microtransaction-fiasco with stats on skins i can say i can't recommend the game at this state. overkill really dug themselves into their own grave, they had so many opportunities and they just took the cashgrab route, crimefest for free ? yeah f you too.",0
surprisingly boring for a game with a 'chest bounciness' slider,0
"a tower defence game where you get to join in on the shooting fps style. at first i was put off when i watched total biscuit play with the devs in one of his 'wtf is' videos. got the game on sale anyway to give it a go and it was much more fun than his video made it look. it might possibly be down to it being much more tense in single player than the -player mode he played, especially when you have to watch spawns at opposite ends of the map by yourself. if you like fps's and tower defence games then this should be an enjoyable addition to your collection.",1
"i'm not saying it's hu, but it's hu. if you haven't played a shmup before, this is going to hurt. the key here is to endure and press on if you want to win. persistence and determination. it also helps if you git gud. out of play if you're a masochist or learned to surf bullets in the same manner any sane human being would learn to surf waves at the beach.",1
"one of the least polished twin stick shooters around. avoid this game if you can. it's not even worth it when it costs a dollar or two. the game has poor shooting mechanics, and a very bland and repetitive style overall. good concept but terrible execution overall.",0
"look. i'm sure if i put hours i could be good at this game. but it would not be fun, it takes forever to do anything. the interface is painfully bad. and yeah, this game was cheap but to be honest it's not even worth a dollar. oh, and yes i haven't even put an hour into the game but just getting to the first game was a painful experience. this game is just painfully bad. like not even entertainingly bad.",0
the queue is making the game bad for everyone. mostly for the people who crash alot. so suddenly they crash in the queue so they have to restart in around queue. the game will receive alot of dislikes. honestly i like the game but ever since the steam intergration the game has queues of insane proportions. the game has gone wrong by going on steam. i understand for more players to play but wouldn't that cause less players to play because nobody wants to sit there in the queue for an hour?,0
"this is steam, not the apple store.",0
i can't even start the game because the social club can't connect to steam. wtf please..,0
"damn, where to start, this game blows some serious chunks. overwatch is so much better than this game its not even funny. in overwatch its basically a moba but with fps aspects, this game is just a top down shooter like gta london or some crap, gets boring real fast. it's really no surprise this game is losing players to overwatch. overall i'd give valve a nicetry , but damn i expected better.",0
has a whole lot of issues.enough said.,0
idk why i bought this game..,0
"terrible online experience. if you can get into a match with hacks the game is decent, no where near my top favorite fps ever.",0

does anyone know how to launch this game?,0

omg! the intro with sean bean! i have goosebumps! the menu with the christopher tin music that has little echos of baba yetu is out of this world. based on this alone i give this a huge recommend! i have made one move founded my starting city and moved my warrior and i am already in civilization heaven.,1
"about hours of game content, excluding the grinding for gold and heart. the storyline is pretty cheesy, actually, make that really cheesy, and there are places where you're stuck with click-click-click away that could have been done without, if the interface had an input option or a 'sell all' button. overall it is not much different from its predecessor, so if you enjoyed the first game, you would enjoy this one too.",1
puts the majority of open-world rpgs to shame. i love the combat in this game. fly into free.,1
"so i picked this game up for , managed that with a voucher that had it at off, its not a bad game, it has alot of bad reviews despite the gameplay itself. i think the biggest problem for this game itself is theres alot better rpg's on the market. if you can see past, old english language text and not many voice actors, and a bad battle system you will enjoy two worlds. i gave it a outta , personally you would be better off playing skyrim really!",1
"dead pixels is a pixel based shooter i hope you already figured this out from the title . you play a guy who is trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. you have to make your way through the world killing zombies and buying upgrades and weapons. there is a good deal of replayability as well. multiple game modes spice up the fun even more! i am not usually a fan of zombie survival games as of late it feels like there are a lot of them now but i like this one. also it reminds me a little of binding of issac, so thats something. i would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a cheap indie game.",1
welp another amazing game ruined by pay to win - sure buy whatever you want permanently but wait first buy this premium so you can buy it,1
"i bought this game due to someone i know enjoying it and figured i would give it a try. i have to say, i regret doing so. the game is so straight forward and lacks any sort of new ingenuity. i know it's supposed to be a 'throw back' game, but damn. it's just too much. your characters classes are dull. it gives the hint of leveling up freedom to bend the classes somewhat, but with the point system your basically making one type of character, or making a super weak useless character that 'breaks the mold'. the story seems deep at first, but i found it was sort of 'meh' after a point. the in game npcs are horrible. there is a certain might and magic vibe to the game. if you were really into the m amp m games and want to play something like them again. perhaps this game is for you. if not, i can't suggest it.",0
"drop down into the battlefield! no more spawning and pre-defined positions, you choose where you want to be, you fly from the sky towards your objective, crashing down in the midst of war, gun firing all the while, shooting down enemy after enemy, and just as you sigh with relief to your teammates that the control point was succesfully taken over, you look into the sky and see shimmering streaks falling down, enemy reinforcements just arriving to take back their territory. section is my favourite fps, it allows brilliant tactics, has graphics that aren't too shabby, and the gameplay is simply awesome! furthermore, you can call in vehicles, supply drops, turrets, whatever you need in the midst of the battlefield to satisfy your needs! hold your position, or bring hell to the enemy!",1
"this is the best gaming series i've ever played, it might be hard to get into but it's worth man it's worth.",1
"thief is an immersive stealth game that takes in the aspect of garrett, the master thief. thief is a great reboot that defines stealth very well and when i say stealth, i mean not touching or interacting with a single soul around you, staying quiet and panther-like. you are a thief that now has a story, a meaning of which you pursue to find out what happens to your apprentice. this is a great experience combined with some tactics and gadgets that you possess, you can play the game however you want, finding alternative routes, using different weapons and equipment to outsmart your enemies and do what thieves do best-- steal without trace. i personally love the story and the punishing master thief difficulty.",1
excellent graphics and plot line! lots of expression!,1
"a story driven title with a fantastic soundtrack, great atmosphere, and a lot of heart. one of my best purchases on steam.",1
i think the best ww strategy game ever! with lots of levels. and muti-player is awesome ..i wish i could make tiger,1
"very few games have left me as immersed as cave story. from the very start, i loved the story and it kept me going the entire way through. not to mention the amount of collectibles, weapons, and multiple story paths you can take. this game left me wanting more cave story, and that isn't a bad thing! do yourself a favor and by this indie gem.",1
havent played much of it but it is very fun and a good game to grind time. for the price would recomend p,1
cant get to rum. only plays the game advertisment,0
"cannot be completed unless you are savvy investor in a golden suit. yes that is from game lol no, but seriously, the beginning of it is nice and addicting. buy more buy more.. but then.. it loses its point and becomes pretty boring. do not buy anything in-game unless you don't know what to do with the money or you want tg free, click n buy, fun start - boring late game, that's pretty much it wallstreetiseasy out of would not buy oil rigs again",0
very glitchy!! kept shutting down.,0
clearly you sticks haven't learned from the first game. stop your ing peeps,0
"this game is an insane amount of fun! it brings me back to my days of pumping quarter after quarter into machines in the arcade, except with much better graphics. the four different game modes are challenging, especially minefield mode, where you don't have any offensive weaponry at all and must rely on your defensive armaments to take out your foes. survival is probably one of the more difficult ones classic is more like galaga galaxian space invaders where you can't let the aliens get past you since you're the last line of defense . defend is more like a tower defense-style mode, where you have to keep your satellites safe for a set time period thankfully there are turrets to help out . i already mentioned the better graphics i think that the artwork on this game is really good. sound effects are pretty good as well, although unlike the previous reviewer, i didn't have an issue with the music. i thought it fit pretty well. finally, i would highly recommend using an xbox controller to play this game controls are much more fluid. i highly recommend this game, especially if you love twin-stick space shooters, and a challenge!!",1
"just imagine if this game was fully baked. sleeping dogs is a game where you play as an undercover cop who attempts to infiltrate into a triad gang. it's essentially a gta from the police perspective- expect the rule's aren't quite the same for those undercover.. lots of melee combat here- you're pretty much bruce leeing the hell out of everyone most of the time. gunplay is included too, but not very much of it. in all honesty the guns seem like an afterthought. they do unrealistically low damage and are extremely hard to get. you'd think every gangster would be packin', but nope. the sheer number of things that you can do in this game is insane. in all honesty, this game could have become a series that would rival gta easily if it was just finished better. you're still getting a great game with lots of gameplay though. also the dlc is meh, though the cop one is pretty good.",1
"what are you waiting for? buy it, kill xeno scum and save the earth. why are you still reading this!? you should be playing already!",1
nrs dropping the game and sweeping it under the rug is unacceptable,0
bought it to play with a friends and.. you can only play the story alone. the only 'coop' mode is a moba like .. only buy it if you intend too play this game alone.,0
"this game is terriable, but that you for the refund steam! it's sad thinking back to the inception of this franchise, the realistic guide of band of brothers that they seemed to follow, cod is what got me into pc gaming back in the early s late ninetys. . the real weapons, real locations, competitive maps and gameplay. remember the realism of saint-mere-eglise? before my refund i noticed robinhood in bo , except it was a girl and she was running sideways on walls. call of duty needs to do right by themselves and what they're, rename this franchise to something more like halo, aliens, or the like. this is not call of duty, one more release until this crap goes sci-fi for reals. bring on fallout , bye. thanks for the refund steam. cod is officially dead for me. my poor childhood is over. thank you for the good memories cod, sorry i was not able to change my interests over the years. i just miss the big red one, the m , the authentic uniforms and locations. i never thought you would go down this freakish road.",0
"i tryd to refund this game and was declined due to the fact that steam in stalls a launcher that in turn downloads and installs the game itself, now i dont have the fastest internet and installing the game took hours and steam saw that as time played, i have another hours in updates. iv only played the game for around to mins even then it wasn't the game for me. please steam i would like my refund",0
"this game wasn't for me. i liked the story and the quest seemed intriguing, but the game logic was a little to hard for me to make the connections. perhaps i am a lazy gamer? i liked exploring and solving the puzzles, but i didn't grow up with point and click adventure games and so i lose my patience when the game doesn't have a way for me to find the next step with a intermediate amount of exploring. i don't like having to find one item and dragging it to the next thing and then learning through cryptic clues about point b..",0
"despite the alleged 'release' of this game, it's still in essentially a beta state. it still contains game-breaking bugs at the most fundamental level ie inability to add characters to your party. please stop 'releasing' games that are still essentially in beta. if i wanted to help trouble-shoot your game, i wouldn't have waited until 'release' to buy it. feeling ripped off atm.",0
"i was really excited for this game when watching it on youtube. this is a game you better off playing with friends than randoms. game needs serious balancing, especially playing the killers. unless you plan on playing with friends online, not a high recommendation. you will get frustrated.",0
"initially the game was great, a breath of fresh air into the fps genre. but now i can't help but feel like the payday fanbase and community are being used as cash cows. the dlc for this game is bizarre, requiring you to pay which i'm sure will increase over time for the complete experience, and without the dlc, your ingame arsenal heist options will feel quite meager. recently overkill have released the addition of safes into the payday world which rely on you paying a sum of real money to open, the reward of which the player might not even be able to implement if they do not own the correct dlc. i can't help but feel mislead and disapointed from overkill's decision to add microtransactions in the game, which they had stated a while ago that if anyone was to think that overkill were going to add microtransactions, they should be ashamed of themselves. it feels as though they are just adding the safe mechanic to generate more money from the games fans.",0
"bought it because of vr-support. but there is no vr-support..if it would be an early access games, i could understand it..",0

"nba k what can i say..this costs me . for the michael jordan edition and by the time it gets convertered to aus dollars it cost me . what a rip off! if that wasn't enough i went to change the controls to suit my keyboard, please exit cant do that. all the control buttons are suited to a controller eg xbox and asigned to the controller buttons. jump shot is rs i have not rs on my keyboard k you nit wits, i have letters and no like a amp s amp w. why would you want to play a game that you can't change the controller type to suit a keyboard. im sorry i didn't pay . to work out what controllre button corresponds to a keyboard button. i have requested steam to provide me refund for this game. very very disgruntled",0
"don't starve together is simply one of the best sandbox survival game i have ever played. the art is very unique.. let's say it is creepy yet cute! the survival system is incredible addicting since you need to plan ahead what to do to survive in the next season. there are a lot of stuff to learn and you will die a lot at the beginning but fear not! learn from your failure and do it better next time imo this game is incredible fun if you play it with friends or alone. joining random servers is fun too but don't get too attached with your character there cause most of them will do a clean wipe when everyone dies. doesn't matter if you are online or not the developers are very passionate, shipping out regular updates and the result is a strong community and modders that creates lot of entertaining custom content in the workshop so you won't get bored easily p i highly recommend this game, even without sales it's worth the money!",1
"absolutely disgusting. the computer blatantly forgoes strategy simply to stuff it in the human player's . i was playing expert using human profiles for myself against computers. i had red in africa and blue in south america. gold had australia and a foothold in europe. my african boarders were all protected with soldiers, and green who had europe did not have more than on a single territory. so what does gold do? does he take the logical approach and secure europe for himself? fuuuuuuck no. he plows a trail through africa into south america, just to plant men there. the computer literally disregarded obvious strategy just to ram in against the human players both were me in this case, and believe me, my is sore . it's bad enough that the dice roll is blatantly biased in favor of the computer to the point that i sent sets of territories against territory defended by soldier, and lost or soldiers doing so, but to have the computer not even operate strategically is just too much. i want to like this game, but they should have worked on these mechanics a little more.",0

"this game..is so great! it's racist against swords and has dancing zombies. all shall become cthulpy too! cthulpy meaning a cthulhu groupie, that needs to be trademarked somewhere.",1
i really recommend this game if you love racing simulators and the pure race action. that's one of the best you can buy. good living online community is big advantage of this game.,1
"this new long term approach to magic's 'casual' games is a big improvement over the duels of the planewalkers and magic xx titles. with each new expansion adding new content and a reasonable ability to play human and computer opponents, this manages to be a good time killer while you're on lunch or whatnot. it'll likely keep getting better with new releases as well. it isn't without its flaws though, so be warned. - it buggy, often crashing when you open packs, and some cards don't work like they should - the control interface is currently poor, and occasionally infuriating, but could be fixed in future updates - the story mode is really bad. with plot points like 'your friends disagree with your approach to this problem, beat them nearly to death in order to come to an agreement! other than those things, it's pretty good. certainly worth the free price tag for the download.",1
"completely broken save system resulted in me playing the minute unskippable-cutscene tutorial mission twice. the game creates 'autosaves' but shows them as 'locked' unless you beat the hour long linear level milestones. in a non-linear game like dark souls this system works, but this is a shooter on rails with a single scripted story path. i'd avoid this game unless they fix this issue",0
"undoubtedly one of the best rpg's ever made. combining a campaign map with real-time battle maps in a similar style to the total war franchise but in which you control a single army within your faction, the game takes on a more personal feeling than total war. the faction and relationship systems create a miniature game of thrones, enabling you to contend with your rivals for power, both against enemies and allies. furthermore, warband possesses one of the most enjoyable and immersive battle systems in any game. although the graphics may be poor, the gameplay more than makes up for it. a perfect example that flashy graphics are not necessary for an awesome game. the countless mods available for this game only add to its brilliance. the developers support for the modding community makes the mods easy to install and play and some of them are arguably even better than the base game. definitely worth trying out. out of",1
"free battle ngajak temen pakek stick rage on, best feel positivenya -characternya cukup banyak -arenanya mantep -cameranya gak begitu jelek -enjoyable negativenya -lama buat sampe ke checpoint ato save'an di game ini -cukup lama untuk story tellingnya tapi gue tetep recommend, beli ni game, terus maen bareng temen, and.. rage on!! , out of sangat recommend",1

its ok some of the characters are cute i guess,1
"it is not worth the price. wait until it costs about . then you maybe enjoy this early access alpha thing. it is not deep at any time. after maybe hrs you saw everything the game can deliver. i repeat everything. thats crazy! worst buy ever on steam for me. hello games you, i want my money back!",0

"i love this game but i'm gonna have to give it a hard no in its current state. i remember seeing this game on moddb as a mod for men of war. normal men of war. i was so excited to play it and thought it looked really cool. i waited, waited, waited. then it finally came out on steam as an early access game in my freshman year of college. i was so excited, i had been waiting for it since my freshman year of highschool. imagine the disappointment i felt when i purchased the game in early access and didn't get the full thing when it was 'fully released'. yeah, don't buy this game.",0

"for once pixel art used properly. fantastic gameplay with the fast restart when you fail that is addictive. so many games use pixel art and ropey controls and get hyped up relying on the nostalgia factor i played through the and -bit era, not every element of the games need be brought back , but this is brilliant. the pixel art goes really well with the time, colour, and most of all fantastic gameplay. also great story and one of the best game soundtracks in years.",1
"..some kind of badly-made art-house kind of game? very basic adventure game terrible screen tearing , poor controls and it lasts less than the minute reviews i'd set myself for each game.. some kind of social commentary look at issues kind of thing? it's so badly done that you won't care.. abysmal and ultimately completely pointless",0
"this game combined a bunch of elements that i really liked. it gave you the building and terraforming ability of minecaft, the potential we'll get to this in a minute ability to work together with friends, and a leveling-by-using skill system. so, you can build your own hideaway, town, or whatever, you still have to survive and stuff in here's deadly! , and you forge your own path on what you're going to develop. but. frickin' but. we have tried, so very hard, my friends and i, to host a server and have them see it, and to have them run a server so we can see it. we're no slouches in hosting servers. we cannot see each other, and the boards seem to suggest this is a real craps shoot. that's not how multiplayer and servers should be. because it takes out the interactive element that really makes it enjoyable, for now, i cannot recommend this game. i may change it if wurm takes steps to address this.",0

"quite boring, as for me.",1
"overall, very nice game! the only thing that bothers me is the controls, so i would recommend a controller to play if you have one. if you don't, try using keyboard. the keyboard is hard if you didn't memorize the keys for the keyboard but if you did then it would be easier for you. spending money on this game is worth it, trust me.",1

good . but has issues for some people when it comes to playing on a huge gal map with max races at about turns you will get alot of turn lag . idk if its everyone or just some . but it is still a realy good x game,1

"got game. attempted training just for the heck of it. wasted minutes trying to blow a stationary person up with a grenade. uninstalled, got knife in tf . also, i've heard about there being a keylogger within this game. it's meant to encrypt your keypresses to protect against malicious keyloggers. they may have removed it, because i couldn't find the files the community said were used for it. better safe then sorry, though, so you should check to make sure it isn't there once you install the game. reasons for not reccomending? the training session tried to pull me into the game with a set of boobs. stop this please, game devs. i had to spend minutes to blow a guy up in the training track. i didn't play the game past that.",0
this game is unplayable in the late game due to lag. it's also just bad in general. overyhyped as . give us china ck please.,0
"a simple game which is similar to hangman of which you guess the missing letters of made up passwords. every words completed you get a bypass to skip a word. there is a timer and every time you get a letter wrong in the game, the timer goes down some more. worth a try if you're into word games as it is free.",1
"they ed everything up, so.. no. fun fact i put the same amount of effort in to this 'review' as ubisoft devs put in to this game bonus fun fact this is in no way a tom clancy game. just sayin",0
this game is great. if you want fast paced skull crushing action with much of a challenge on the side i recommend this game!,1
"so much fun! the combat plays like an even more polished version of the batman games. the controls are not clunky in the slightest, everything feels really tight and responsive. the game runs very well, even on my year old system, with all settings at or near max. the biggest plus, for me, is the nemesis system. killing random orcs is fun, but it's the encounters with the orc captains that really sets the game apart. each orc captain has a different personality, and they each will remember encounters if you come across them again. affecting the power struggles internal to the orc army is really interesting. so far i've played for roughly hours, and i've still only done or of the main story missions because the nemesis system is so engrossing!",1

very simple if you enjoy good games play this one. turn-based squad play without the micromanagement crap of simcity or similar. easy to pick up when you have a few minutes or you can play for hours. highly recommended since i think it is my game with the highest number of hours.,1
"great gameplay. horrendous menus. unintuitive. zero mouse support for menus that go levels deep, having to scroll up and down and left and right through everything item one at a time. pressing buttons to compare, then equip item in the limited time between waves, instead of being able to use a mouse and click once or twice is unforgivable. considering how much time is spent comparing and swapping out loot, it ruins what is otherwise a fun game.",0
nice game good with recording and best game ever out of,1
"i just was not overly impressed with this game. the emotional build up was nice as you begin to discover more of what went on in the main character's past, but i was disappointed by the predictable turn of events. it's a cliche love story gone wrong. i really did want to like it, but it didn't deliver to my expectations. running back and forth and clicking until you discover some new thing makes for pretty shallow gameplay in my opinion.",0
"this came as part of a humble bundle and is officially the worst game in my library. do not recommend, it is an absolute waste of energy, there is nothing good about this game. i'm not even a fan of the series and the quality of the dialogue is offensive to me, whoever is responsible for writing this game should be eternally banned from writing in any medium. this game was clearly someone's job to make, it has no soul, it isn't funny, and it looks passable at best. out of",0
recommended for those nostalgic for old lucasarts adventure games. the art is fantastic and has a childish quality that is perfect to play with your kids and or niece and nephews. a perfect gateway to introduce the new generation to point-and-click adventure games.,1
"though i've played it on for hours at least over the years, and tried it out on here, i would still spend all those hours on it again and again with pleasure. i cannot describe my love for this first, and in my opinion best, of the mass effect trilogy. out of would for months again",1
"i realy enjoy this game and so i think it would be even more better with multiplayer co-op, pvp, ctf, tdm, ect",1
did i really spend for such a short game damn,0
"incredibly slick endless runner-style game, where the goal is to run and jump with perfect timing in order to increase your speed and earn more points. the visuals are minimalistic but convey all you need to know in the game, and the first person perspective can make the game quite exhilarating at times which may be a problem for those suffering with motion sickness . coupled with the fitting electronic soundtrack, this is a great game for fans of platformers or those who want to experience something new in the genre.",1

"game, port, controls are awful, you can even use all of your consumables using a mouse and keyboard, once again because it is a port. this game is a total let down from what they were showing back in , nothing like it, but thats what games are now, false hopes and lies, bucks worth of it too.",0

"metal gear solid v is a frankenburger. the design is flawless. countless hours of painstaking research have gone into creating the most perfectly designed burger ever, with every aspect of its composition being fine-tuned for perfection. you could write a thesis about how absolutely perfectly crafted this burger is. but there's a dark side to it. it doesn't look that great when you finally get it on your plate. and it might have looked better, if it had more time to be prepared. it's loaded with chemical additives and perservatives that make you feel bad when you're finished eating it. the story behind this burger is a tragic tale of souless corporate s demanding that the perfect burger be created and shipped out to restaurants, even if it isn't as perfect as it could be with more time and love. but it, when you're eating it, when it's in your mouth and you're swallowing down those chemical additives and heart-killing greases, you'll swear it's the best thing you've ever eaten. tl dr, the gameplay godlike but the story is half-finished and kinda disappointing, which may or may not be a problem depending on your tastes.",1

someone scraped by in their a level it class with this 'production'.. they totally kicked in their english lit tho!! also if that review wasn't interesting enough.. imagine ff .. without a directional keypad.. or the other cds of content.. and a professional artist on a half day temp contract.. and the artwork took more than day ..and sephiroth was whiney as hell ..and it was formatted for the nintondo game boy .. and it featured emos.. oh wait.. scratch that.. it's pokemon without the pokemon.. and team rocket is a euphamism. also.. there's no way the product you serve is worth of your creatively intended .. there's just too little involvement to call this a 'game'. summary ---------- i would feel less like i've been cheated out of my money if a tramp i just gave my to use it to light his cuban cigar. im sure you would excel in creating games to draw people to websites and gain more money in traffic affiliation than you would selling games on steam if you don't plan on reworking your dedication to creative development.,0
"this is a very very good free game. i actually have more than hours into the game, but i did not play it on steam previously. the game has microtransactions, which i don't genereally like, but on the bright side you can grind for most of the stuff in the game. as of right now, i would say that the biggest issue is how worthless the kubrews are. they last a couple days and when they die you have to do the whole process again.",1
"the comminuty isn't so big right now, but doing missions with friends is a blast!",1
this is a great game to play on windows pc but on a mac its a different story. the issue comes up playing with medium to large maps. the framerate drops to around fps which is dreadful. it could be an issue with the yosemite operating system. i hope they fix problem soon until then if you want to play this on a mac i would not recommend this game.,0
"this game is nothing more than a 'hidden object' game with some 'bejeweled' thrown in. it wastes a lot of your time with pointless dialogue and 'extra content' that isn't even good in terms of story. this game is annoying throughout with many agitating features and problems that would cause even children to become frustrated or bored.. so, who's this game aimed at? not sure.",0
"it's a great game in general. it's has bugs but this just came out days ago so what do you expect? i bet they will fix all the bugs and hopefully make the bad guys easier to fight in solo. edit nevermind the solo difficulty part, i found this trick that really helps how to not lose playing solo nbsp",1

"very similar to the third game, just as good, if not better. out of",1
this game is badass. reminds me of old school doom quake arena games with my favorite style of cell shading. it game play is flat out addictive. metal soundtrack is pretty awesome but at little repetitive. i would love to get my paws on the dlc expanded sound track. i got this game as a bundle from bundlestars.com for bucks. easy was to save dollars off.,1
much better than torchlight . game zones and acts feel more like diablo which is a good thing. the game is very replayable. they have new game plus modes and lots of end game gear sets to collect. this game is also set up well for co-op. i would recommend this game.,1

"recursion deluxe is a super fun puzzle platformer. its simple but clean design only adds to the charm of the game, and it has a joyous soundtrack that keeps you in high spirits even after you die from that darn bee again. it's a great game to play, especially when you're a busy worker and only have time for a short break. this is your game.",1
"i really enjoy it, great challenging platformer, a bit hard but doesnt give u a reason to get out and punch sombedy in the nuts",1

"this game has several known issues that the devs have done nothing about, mainly crashes and the steam overlay not working. i am editing this a long while after my original review, and i can confirm the bugs are still there. for example, the game crashes when you shoot the large green cubes with a shotgun.",0
"this game is my first and now my last total war, the game wont even start. it keeps crashing on startup ive done everything and nothing works",0
it has great weapon physics but not too many players. mostly russian. hard to find nice servers. save your money and buy global offensive instead of this.,0
"played this for a while since it came out and i must say i can already tell why this game is the best storm game so far, it has sooooo much content u can easily get over hours play time, after the story mode, there is an adventure mode where you are playing the events after the story the war , which is good because they have the open world event back where you get to explore the world of naruto without the limits that storm had, also team ultimates are back and i found it so much fun going through each and everyones ultimates and online fights i still have to try out.. there are alot of negative reviews going on about this game due to people having issues with the game running which actually got me worried for a while about getting the game but i had issues so far and has been the most fun experience ever..plus no fillers like the anime so . out of must play if you are a naruto fan because the anime is never going to finish",1
its a horable game with almost no story line. i am a fan of ac and i will not touch this again. it also has this weird glitch were if you press esc instead of the menu it will take me to a blank screen.,0
bought the game on this account months ago and still no help from official forumon why it wont run. already reinstalled multiple time and reinstalled xna and frameworks multiple times,0
"i'm very disappointed with this download and here's the reason. apparently, if you register and try to link your account but it fails, you can no longer use that account to play the game. a complete waste of money. i'm so sick of se making you do stupid stuff like this to play their games.",0
"breath taking, best game ive ever played",1
the puzzles if you want to call them that are trying to figure out what they want you to do with the controls. half the crap that you can 'interact' with is pointless and just there to add more clicks. there is no way that i would recommand anyone play this crap.,0
"this game does not exactly play like i thought it would. for some reason i was expecting a story-driven game, perhaps with a dark twist. that is not what this is. instead, this is a bizarre platformer where you walk around peeing on everything. i decided to give it a go anyway. why not, right? i finally had to stop playing, not bc of the gameplay, but bc of a glitch. i jumped when i should have kept walking and got stuck standing in fire while peeing, with frogs and spiders coming out of, well, you know where they were coming out of. mildly disturbing, i know. and nothing in the gameplay, if you can call walking around and peeing on literally everything and everyone 'gameplay', did not make up for the very strange nature of the game. i do not recommend this to anyone. i've got a twisted sense of humor, but this 'game' does not seem to have any point. other than to walk around and pee on everything. so, no.",0

game is fun but its community is lots of mad and salty kids being afk just deleted it,0
"i got the key indirect from the developer to write this review. it didn't influence my recommendation i played this game for days now and finished it after about hours. i thought about it a while but finally came to the decision that i can't recommend it to everyone, but to those who are really fans of this genre or want to test their vr-headsets. the game isn't bad, but it's just not enough for a recommendation. if i have to give points, i would say it is a out of where everything above would get a recommendation. what i liked about the game",0
"the company trying deperately to monetize this game will be the death of it. hopefully they will see these steam ratings and reverse the current paywall decisions. that said companies do have to make money so instead of screwing over the player base how about making the entire core game with trading and everything free and then devote time to making cosmetics such as skins effects wings emoticons etc. you could then charge for these cosmetics, with maybe dungeon updates every couple months. take a page out of companies like riot games and go this route for gods sake. respect your player base and provide a quality game and people will spend money on cosmetics.",0

short game with little content. to get to later levels you have to timesink several runs to upgrade your global stats. enemies are simple and leave you wanting more. gameplay is rather slow.,0
very bad game and boring all that needs to be said,0
"extremely buggy - dumbed-down game. the sound can be very disorientating with voices 'jumping' through walls and sounding like the npc is next to you. terrible. jumping is contextual - you can't jump wherever you want. takes away from the thief feel and loses immersion. i'm only halfway through and not sure whether to bother completing it. think i'm going to go back to skyrim instead which is what thief should have been aimg to be as good as.. very disappointed in thief. was expecting much better considering it's from eidos montreal - i just hope they keep the thief development team away from the next deus ex game - we don't want any of them ruining that! they might have sold a lot of copies but that just means that theirs sales pitch was good, or that lots of people wanted to give it a chance - it does not mean that the actual product is any good. it isn't.",0

the redux version improves upon the original game. still has some occasional bugs. you will get the most out of the story like with the sequel if you set the character dialogue to ukrainian or russian. some things dont translate properly into english. the game does not do anything exceptionally well graphics are gorgeous . i enjoyed it mostly for the fact that it offers a different experience story approach to the typical western-made game.,1

"terrible, wouldn't even launch. i tried many different troubleshooting steps found on various forums and nothing worked. in all honesty, i don't even care to get it working now. no matter how great the game might be, it wasn't even worth the i paid for it. it would be better if steam removed the game from their platform until it was patched, at least then the company may fix the issue. issues like these are why i'd rather pirate games and then spend the money for the legit version once i know that the software is actually worth it.",0

"don't buy this. they say that they're inspired by the old classic survival horror games but they aren't. in those games you could defend yourself or even run away fairly easily, this one, not so much. look i didn't get far enough into the game to be able to suggest whether you should play it or not, but i really didn't have to to get the experience i would be having throughout the entire game. the game makes it so that you have a stamina meter, but if you stop moving for half a second the monster catches up to you and you die. the music, from what i gathered was cliche, it wasn't horrible, so that's a bonus i guess. the cutscenes have no voice acting, only subtitles while they quickly switch between slides, giving you no time to read what the characters are saying unless the subtitles take up more than one slide. this is not how you make a horror game.",0
"man, i was years old when this game came out, and i remember going to eb games, picking up the demo after buying swords adventures, came home, and played the crap outta it. i loved it. i had limited money, and i'd always use it to build bunkers, and start fires after trapping my minions in there. it was perfect.",1

"originaly, this was a very fun game. it had the best graphics ever seen in a block game, mysteries and puzzles, a feel that you must destroy all dungeons, and best of all it's free. this was the perfect game to just go on a few random quests with a made-up story you just made in your mind, or even just hangout with your best friends, however it gets very very old. after a few weeks of playing, it just loses all the excitement. there aren't any updates good enough to lure old players back, and you are basically doing the same exact thing every single day of your life. it takes so much to get to a high enough level to make things interesting. because of these features, i just can't recommend this game.",0

"pretty fun. beat the campaign on hard in about hours, and it offered a fun challenge. some parts can be spooky, while others focus on shooting so there's a good mix. lots of secrets hidden around aswell, in audio logs and locked doors cabinets, aswell as meeting some survivors. does get slightly repetitive towards the end though, and the final boss battle wasn't as epic as i pictured, but was still worthwhile. solid out of . i'd recommend playing through it on hard, simply because it makes the game more fun.",1

"an absolute gem of a game! if you are mildly interested in platformers this is the game for you. its imo one of if not the best platforming game of the last years. it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry and it will most certainly make you angry. pros - beautiful visuals - amazing soundtrack - perfect control over the characters movement - length of the game is long enough to be fun, but not too long to be tedious - character progression cons - highly recommend a controller, knm will ruin your day! - sometimes really hard and frustrating git gud! if you don't already have it, get it now on sale! stop reading do it!",1
"overall, it was a fun and enjoyable game. i still have yet to complete it, but so far many aspects of the game are well executed and the difficulty level is well balanced. likes the soundtrack is amazing and well worth the purchase the artwork and dialogue are very well done and really draw you into the story line great execution of linear gameplay with good combat mechanics great story line and use of comic book style cutscenes good amount of loot with varied statistics dislikes some of the narration dialogue felt very formal, more like a history lesson than an immersive narration",1

"when i first played defense grid, i wasn't sure what to think of it. i had gotten it for the potato portal arg thing, and it was one of the ones i had to glance over really fast. coming back to it, i found myself actually liking the game itself. it's a cute little tower defense game. build towers to make mazes and slow the enemies advance to your power generator. the plot is a bit dumb, and it doesn't usually matter, but the game itself is simple and fun. if it's cheap, get it! i liked it.",1

"its the same as the old version i have played them to death years ago for bucks its a ripoff. the campaign map is terrible, you'd think if you were going to re-release something it would be at least user friendly. ai has not changed either with the enemy tanks turning right before yours so you can easily penetrate their sides. not much has changed since the 's versions, it just looks like a money grab.",0
"after being pelted with lore and story for half an hour, to the point that i ended up hammering the esc key i never do this in any other games , i got to the game. it looks like morrowind and moves like a board game. i ploughed through the entire elder scrolls series, looks and even gameplay don't bother me. but this.. this is just too for me to work with. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone who finds the idea of your entire party being invisible and moving one space at a time like a chess piece remotely appealing. i also heard that it gets unfairly difficult later on down the line, so.. yeah, screw this game.",0

"this is a complete disaster of a release. for anyone who enjoyed the pc release of motorhead, this is not it. this is the psx version. the screenshot previews of the game do not even do the shoddy graphics justice. it gave me a headache to even try to play this in fullscreen, and windowed mode is not much better. this game is also impossible to play with a keyboard, which is what i used to play the game back when it was originally released, and the controls cannot be modified. so please do your best to enjoy utilizing both wsad and the num pad not only to drive your vehicle, but to decrypt the main menu navigation, as the mouse does absolutely nothing. please do not waste your money on this game. there were no reviews for it when i purchased it, so i had no forewarning of how bad of a port it would be. you're better off finding the pc port elsewhere. it's a vastly superior experience to this version.",0

"a classic, one of, if not, the best arcade game there is. metal slug is frantic, insane, and a tense game that will keep your reflexes in check. all of the levels are fantasticly made, with thier own little secrets in them. the fact this has online play is amazing itsself, as this game is best with a friend! along with local multiplayer, one using a gamepad, the other a control, two controllers, or both on one keyboard! highly reccomend it, not many arcade games come close to metal slug in terms of fun and replayability!!",1
"there's only one way to die in blackshadows and that is to let your flashlight batteries run out. and i do mean 'let' because there's enough of them lying around to power a shuttle launch. your average kindle book requires more interaction than this. there are five doors to open, the keys to which lie varying distances away through linear corridors. there is no threat. there's no menu. there's two scares where a light blows out and a lightning crash illuminates your would-be adversary in a corridor but neither of them affect anything you're doing. listening to the opening closing narration takes almost half as long as it does to beat the game. utterly, inarguably pointless.",0

"the ship single player is effectively an extended tutorial for the ship's multiplayer game, lasting a little over an hour. the player is given a series of tasks from an npc which all involve killing one or multiple people in a variety of ways while avoiding detection. it's a good overview of the mechanics, but as an independent game, there's not a whole lot to it, so i can't really recommend it. additionally, there's a few mechanical issues on a couple of the quests that can cause game-breaking bugs where you have to reload your save for example, not getting into an elevator and going downstairs a different way in one circumstance . i can't speak for the multiplayer game's community at this point, and i suppose it might be worth it for people who intend to dive wholeheartedly into the game so they can have some extra experience when going in, but as a standalone game, there's not much there.",0

"this game had a great idea, but fell so short.. i played this game over several months and got to the next to last case. the 'gameplay' was so bad the idea of spending another hour or two to complete the game was like working a job you don't get paid for. which is a shame as there is a story and some okay characters.. the gpx controls sound engine etc.. were all decent, but this should have been a pure puzzle story game with more quests and logic puzzle type gameplay rather than the 'demon' sections which ruined the flow and feel of the game. needed more story and puzzles.. while removing the stupid 'demon' sections ps this is a game which should take - hrs to beat.. the fact that i left it on my hd for so long just goes to show how little the story mattered when related to the boring gameplay.. again, good concept, poor execution..",0

"as a game i can not recommend this. it sounds good, and there are tons of maps. but it feels more like a sandbox-title.. with a bad camera, clumsy controls and odd hit collision-detection. and no storyline, just 'random' maps, with some steam-achievements thrown in. yet somehow not rewarding at all, as there is no soul to it. i find it hard to find any feelings for that title. it is just meh! in a bad way however, one might find it entertaining for some hours running around and killing every creature on any of the endless maps. if you are into grinding, keeping a clean and sorted inventory selling the bad stuff .. this 'game' provides plenty of that - with bad camera, clumsy controls and odd hit collision-detection. ps did i mention the camera?!",0

"buyer beware, if you have windows you are likely unable to launch the game without it crashing and there is zero support for fixing this that works. this problem has been known by the developers for some time and it is unlikely that they will fix now. if you can run it though it's an excellent game with absolutely no equal within its class.",1

"game dev tycoon, a good game needs replay ability, that is something this game has very little of. when the game has its moments of entertainment it loses the player after some hours of play. the game is repetitive and it has little learning experience from the game play. when it does tell you when your game is good or bad it, however does not tell you how to fix it. for the price of the game, and the several hours of entertainment it provides i feel that it is worth the price. pros fast quick fun creative cheap cons gets repetitive quickly lacks an adiquit challange for the gamer simple game machanics",1

"nice game i liked the way you acquired powers and companions if you know the item location its a fast game otherwise exploration and a keen eye is required if you want to play this alone with no help, anything could lead you to progress. that's at least how i felt about the game. anyways the twist is ok and the map size lots of lore that's what i like to see in games lots and lots of books with lore.",1

"i have a love-hate thing for this game. it feels so, very well made, yet i feel like it missed so much potential. i hope they can make up for it in the future dlcs. it's a really fun game, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't feel quite as replayable as the other souls games. the story itself is really well made, the combat is really fun, there are many amazing weapons, and overall the game looks and plays amazingly. i just wish that the game didn't feel as if fromsoft wanted souls gone as fast as possible.",1
"so i completed the tutorial and was like 'well this doesn't seem as hard as people were saying.' then i spent an hour trying to pass the first mission and i'm starting to sweat. game is stressful, but in a good way if you're into that sort of stuff. it's sort of like the sandbox meets a puzzler. wish there was more focus on 'economics' though more buildings, less time constraints from the weather water rising, etc. overall though it's a decent game for what it is, and i hope i can get further through it, complete the first campaign, in order to unlock free mode. and one final thing thank god for steam cloud. because if i ever have to wipe my pc or reinstall this game, it would suck to have to re-do the campaign. yes this game has steam cloud",1

"after playing the original 'sonic amp sega all-stars racing' on a wii, i decided to give a try to this new version of the game. at first i wasn't convinced about the 'transformed' part of the game, but now i must admit that it adds a nice and fresh way of gaming that makes it highly entertaining. i really like the full controller support, though if you have non-xbox controllers it can take some time configuring those. just be sure to clear every key you want to program because when you assing a new one, it just adds it to the original one, resulting in some keys to have several actions another nice thing is the both online and splitscreen multiplayer, allowing you to play with friends both locally and over the internet. the ai can be really challenging, i even had some struggle on medium, which helps to keep the game entertaining overall, this is a really nice game and highly entertaining.",1

"this is a confusing one.. im not sure what to think, but it really drives home the point that family is all that matters. i have never thought that any job or lifestyle in the world should replace that, and the narrative slowly show it. i would recommend it for any casual genre fan, but if you arent one to pay too close attention to detail in games, you may not appreciate it quite like i did.",1

do not get this game it is so broken in so many ways the resent updates are complete and have broken the game that used to be fun to play. it is the by far the worst game to ever sink any time or energy into. it says free to play but it is so hard to play without purchasing a vetern membership it is stupied. i have unfortunately purchesed a day vetern mebership so i will be playing untill it is up and i can't wait to see this game back end of this game. on top of that this game has been in early access for years! like come on retro finish this pile of you call a game. in short stay the away from this game. edit so i took a break from this game for a while came back to see if anything has changed and holly it's worst then before. americans are still the best fac to be in and the m m if anything has gotten better. this game still is a giant sack of can't wait till battlefield comes out. see you all in battlefield,0
"very fun co-op pve shooter, where you team up to perform a reasonable, with some repetition of maps objectives variety of heists. skill trees allow you to customise your combat style as well as your role in the crew which adds some depth and some motivation to heist that same bank for the th time. stealth mechanics are a bit primitive and sometimes being patient and careful isn't as important as being lucky, but it's still a welcome change of pace. it's a shame you have to commit to stealth from the start and be badly nerfed if when it all goes to pieces though..",1

"matchmaking sucks monkey balls, but everything else about it is fantastic.",1
"eh, it was interesting and had tons of textures for the planets, moons, ect however there was not enough options to play with the visual affects. having tracers on everything and the need to hold shift to hide only some of them made it look lame. i wanted to increase the speed that things spin, cause planet affects like super volcanos, and just make things explode to see what would happen if jupitar just exploaded. however i didn't find those options, this is more of a gravity, planet, sun, orbit type of sandbox. not bad, but not as cool as it could have been.",0
"i have this game for quite some time now, but never paid the proper attention to it. big mistake. mount amp blade warband is one of these games that will crave its place in the game universe by showing how awesome it can be by itself. you start as a nobody, with a horse and some gear. the objective is to gain power. you can achieve it by fighting and dealing working with lords and kings. what makes it special is how you work towards this goal. the mechanics are well developed placed, and i can't even recall a bug that me off enough to make me angry at the game. you can build your host by hiring villagers, join a kingdom for some benefits and work hard to replace the current king of said kingdom. if betrayal is not your game, you can join forces to attack other factions and deprive them frm lands and income. plenty of oportunities in this sandbox. if you are a next gen graphics lover, beware it will sure looks outdated. otherwise, if you like an engaging gameplay and the feeling of accomplishment, this is the game for you.",1
i like being able to play as a cop and a street racer but the cars drift to easily and unrealistically which makes the game really frustrating. apart from that it's a decent game but i wouldn't buy it again.,0
dead and unfinished. if you want to play something like this check out gnomoria . it' more or less the same game at half the price.,0
"i give this thumbs down because i disagree with paradox policy of releasing unfinished games content missing, bugs, stability problems and lack of polishing . in stellaris this becomes abundantly clear when you reach latter mid game. to make this clear, i do like dlcs when they are done right. example of a good game release a finished game that can stand on its own without months of hotfixing. after this release dlc every months or so with content worth e. i really dislike the eu ck model.",0
"fun, scary, challenging.. pro has that good oldschool horror where things jump in your face. con the challenge is insane.. on easy i still die almost instantly, i won't give spoilers. but i find certain levels at certain times almost impossible to complete.. seems more like luck based game, less skill wise. but it is definately out of rating.",1
"the interface recreates the tabletop environment very well, without the need to setup or keep track of a ton of tokens. would be nice if there were more multiplayer users, if it was possible to set up or schedule games for future times, or if a list of games being played with number of players and current turn was available so that you know how long until new matches might start.",1

"arma is a hellacious ride to the underbelly of the america dream. to be able to play with warmachines that your daddies only wish they could handle- this is a showcase of the most badass fighting force in the world and how they handle getting their asses slammed all over the place- you can do everything your heart desires as long as it means killing real people in a fake world - other than that, it is a top notch racing game- gotta go fast- gotta be hard- out of for sci-fi majesty",1
second best tycoon game i ever played.,1
i bought this game and now i hate myself and others.,1
!beta opinion! i played this game for . h and after that time i got stuck between waiting and paying for instant action in premium currency. well gold is everywhere in this game and it looks like it will be pay win game.,0

its a backshooters cumparty. gets old fast. unless your'e a backshooter. its hard to find a game that presents a level playing field. discouraging backshooting. where is the honor in backshooting? i suppose that shows what we are made of.,0

"everytime you want to join a job online, its full. but there is no way to know if it's full or not until you load the job and wait min, frustrating.",0
"this is an excellent game. i went into it fully expecting it to be about the evils of government surveillance, and that you would see first hand the terrible effects and repercussions that it will bring. instead i got a very nuanced storyline that presented both sides of the issue, leaving you wondering afterwards if perhaps there is a practical middle ground that can be sought. the gameplay is also very addictive and unique, and there are several endings depending on your choices, with lots of little twists and turns. the game is very intelligent in regards to making your choices make a huge difference in the outcome, even if you think the ones you pick are not that important in the grand scheme of things. one of the best titles i played this past year. highly recommended.",1
"bosses are overpowered. the ranking system is a joke. you mean to tell me that the longer i take to fight a boss, the less experience points i receive? i got exp from the ing manawar. it feels like there is little incentive to progress in this game. the ability to change your spells is simple, but not convenient when you're in a fight trying to execute combos and you accidentally pull up your spell menu and change two of your spells. this game is as engaging as it is disengaging. if you never play this game, you're not missing out.",0
"get to play as a maverick cop who doesn't play by the rules but gets the job done. he also happens to be the big bad wolf. i recently completed this game for the second time after finishing it last year and, although some of the twists were still fairly fresh in my memory, i still enjoyed it. if there is one thing telltale do well is create a great atmosphere to tell a compelling story i guess that is where they got their name from and the wolf among us certainly does that in spades. the music is eerie, the artwork immaculate and the voice acting is spot on. after playing this game and re-reading the graphic novels i couldn't help but hear the voices in the dialogue. the choices, whilst don't actually have a great deal of consequence, still feel tense and still have a more noticable effect than other ttg titles. if you want great storytelling and compelling characters then this 'game' is perfect for you.",1
most addictive and sexy game ever! out of,1
"the whole game is about a spoiler, so if you don't want to get spoiled i suggest you play it by yourself, but.. in my opinion is not worth it. for once it was kinda creepy, but i saw it coming.. also i dind't see the point of the whole dilemma, or maybe i dind't get it, so is fine to and kill you're own children if all hope's lost?? if it was not to make a point, it failed.. and if it was only to scare you, it failed too, and to make things worst, the game was really tedious, find out the word to go back to the keyboard was kinda lazy, and just plain bad. however.. is free, and short.. but still there are better ways to spend mins imo.",0
"great game for h and after that it becomes boring as hell. get to stage and kill hunters or if you are a hunter- kill monster before it evolves to stage , you need to buy dlc to advance to get better hunters monsters. if the game was with all dlc- i would say buy it, but for it is simply not worht it.",0
this is the game that completely destroyed the franchise. saints row was the last good saints row game.,0
"today was the day where i picked this game off my library shelf to do some card farming. this made the top of my alphebetical list, and i must say that it was a pleasure to farm through. it's simple and addicting through repetitive but rewarding level design, a plot that's not the worst, and a phenomenal soundtrack. but would i rack up anything more than, say, hours? probably not. it was a bit too repetitive, and, like many indie games, the plot is never its strongest point. personally, that over mechanics will always compel me to blow more time into the game. it would also be wise to get a controller for the game.",1
"it is worse then unturned, and it doesn't make any sense at all! it is still funny to play, your game crashes when go into a noisy car, there are black zombies running after you and when you kill a normal zombie, you probably lose hp. this game is a troll. but i would still recommend it because there is a sense of humor in it, but i won't because the maker must have been drunk. play unturned if you like these kinda games.",0
it sucks doesnt work thanks for stealing my money s,0
this i a game you just have running in the background while you play other games. this makes the game easy to play. it is odly adicting if you did not like cockieclicker you will most likely not like this game. but i think it is very fun.,1
worst game possible in world - out of,0
i wouldn't reccomend it personally because i like nuking thinks and as far as i could see they're was no weapons of mass destruction but if your looking for a sci fi civ with no nukes then sure get it .,0
"we need s then i can die happy, but seriously this game is amazing it jumps straight into the action but the game is boring if you never played s the choices transfer from s to s which is great because it really feels like you are changing this team of survivors but i have one problem why does spoiler alert kenny look so different??",1
"i played through this game in early access with friends in about an hour and a half. having entered 'full release' i replayed the campaign with the same friends in hours. look, the game runs and plays well for all hours. but after you play through the campaign there's nothing to do. only completionists will run through the game on the other three characters resulting in an astonishing hours of gameplay. from the writing of this review the full release of the game is . i got the game on sale for and am unsure if i got my money's worth is definitely too steep a price. there needs to be something, anything, to bring the player back to the game whether that be added difficulty levels or even just more story content. unless you're a fan of the anime go buy a different game. p.s. you don't seem to be able to change the keybindings.",0
"pls stop buffing and fix the servers. every game i go into everyone is ping except the australians. also it crashes in every game mode after minutes. i didnt have this issue until the latest patch. fury x, i - k . ghz and it lags in zombies whenever i move between districts. resetting graphics to default didnt change anything.",0

this game was promising when it first came out but now there is nothing new being added to it and the only servers i can seem to find people on are the zombe survival ones. could've been a real good game.,0
"short, simple and challenging just like how some games should be.",1
"ripped off. windows bit. this game will not display correctly. tried various fixes listed online but the game still crashes when using most of the menus. the edosoft patch will not work with the steam version, so what is the point of steam. the x tension version will not even load. there appears to be no help available from steam. game requirements are misleading. they just rip off you money then you can go take a jump..",0

"i'm quitting playing now because of a bug which destroyed my savegame. after all the patches the game still feels unfinished and rushed. i'm on , beat the game and am now stuck in a falling animation on a black screen and can't do anything about it. now that's a s h i t t y ending. the story is pretendable if not non-existent, leveldesign and gamedesign feels lazy collect this, destroy that and if it wasn't a batman game, i wouldn't consider playing it. despite all that it was fun. definitely the weakest part of the series, but overall i wouldn't recommend it. rather buy arkham asylum instead.",0

"on the two previous games first and second encounters we had a realistic environment, fearsome monster enemies and a joke of a story. now on this game we have very colorful environments, laughable enemies for their visual and a story that's even more of a joke. despite these differences, the new weapons and some vehicles on some stages, the gameplay is the same run-shoot-dodge-kill like crazy. it's nice.",1
"probably the best single player shooter to have come out since fear, and a fantastic successor to the original doom games.",1
"this game is so freaking cool and i'm not normally into this genre of games. it's as if tron, audio surf, asteroid, and ikaruga all had a child together. symphony has interesting visuals, great difficulty ramping and progression, the game teaches you how to play by you actually playing the game, every song you play will have its own uniquely generated level, and it's a great time killer if you're waiting inbetween matches on other games. you can import all of your own music from any folder on any drive of your computer, including external. when this game goes on sale, consider it a steal, there's a lot of value to be found here and i'm glad i got it.",1

just another steam scm. they should remove the player local as the gane has trouble recognizing more than one x input controller at a time and they should also mention the online community is dead.,0

"challenging, but in a frustrating way. a lot of the reason you make mistakes is because of dealing with the stupid acceleration they decided to place on the characters. it's possible to make challenging games that aren't frustrating and thus, not as fun , but this isn't a good example of such a game. i don't like spending my limited free time being frustrated instead of having fun so if you're like me, i don't recommend this game.",0

"'in only if, you will fail a lot, you will die a lot, and you will undoubtedly be confused' this is actually a good description. but absolutely not in a good way. in this game i felt like a football being kicked around the game with no control over what's happening, or why, or any idea what i should be doing..",0
"this game was not the worst ever. it was an okay setting, the music did fit, but the story was sparatic and i ended up having to look up what to do several times because it just got confusing. i understand it's a point and click but there was no assistance whatsoever to make it even slightly less confusing, not even an explaination of how to control. and the controls were extremely annoying. move your mouse to face something, it swings one way, try to move to a different part of the room, it swings again, i wish it had been key and mouse controlled because then i might not have been so dizzy. overall it would of made a better short story, because then maybe i would have better understood the ending or the story in general.",0

"at first i didn't know what to do on this game. i didn't care much about talking with that shark with a funny voice and thought there wasn't much to do. found this is such a fun game and learned a lot of things on the second hour of my gameplay. the environment colors are amazing, great background music, a bunch of achievements.. - crafting system, which allows you to craft any kind of items - building, armor, weapons, tools.. - claim great rewards for xp earned and achievements completed - evolve your character - have a pet and a house - destroy or create terrain of any kind - travel on a snail - zombie aliens - friendly shark out of will play again.",1

"if you like making portals this is a good game. it reminds me of when you are in an airplane and the seats are falling out and you need to get out of the plane quickly, its the same excitement as that situation. if you've ever had that situation, if you haven't, this game will certainly train your body to be ready for the exciting experience.",1
"that game is really hard but you just can't put the controller down until you figure out how to cross each zones without getting hurt. this game is like a dark soul d platformer, which is really a good thing. all in all a really solid buy because even if there is not a whole lot of stages, it will take you a while to clear them all!",1
i first heard about ftl through rumors and the mumblings of drunks on the rooster teeth podcast. then i started watching some streams on twitch. that then turned into me buying it and i now have over hours put into this game with no regrets. i recommend ftl because it's increadible fun and challenging yet simple and you can jump in and out of it at any time.,1

"i would higly reccomend this game, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. if you got sick and tired of rpgs and their same old formula this might be for you. no animu protags, grinding for hours or generic evil forces to be found in this game. however this gaem despite in my opinion having a great story it can be easily ruined by the 'wonderful' fanbase. if you don't like the moral of 'killing monsters is bad' this game isn't for you. the best part besides the soundtrack this and touhou are the soundtracks i listen to the most playing other games are the character. you have papyrus who is has the personality of a hillarious old school cartoon villian. undyne who acts like an animie rival and asgore the tragic villian who hates to fight and you just feel bad for. there a criticism i have for the game which are the puzzles and pixel art that's almost as laughable as zun's art. this game isn't for everyone but if this is your cup of golden flower tea you'll love it. shout out to simpleflips",1

nooooo! don't buy even if its on sale. you can get better indie games than this!,0
"if you do not nominate this for the i'm not crying, there's something in my eye award' then you obviously haven't played the game for more than minutes",1
not sure what all the hype was about. the game is gorgeous but the story is thin and the game is so short and not worth what it costs. it is my fault for getting caught up in the hype and pre-ordering. i would have gotten a refund but my son played as well and the playtime is over hours. save your and get something else.,0

"this game is good - really good. and it's easy to lose hours playing - good tension with the prospect of anything hiding behind the door.. but then i realise that every ship is pretty much exactly the same with very similar interiors and room design.. then creeping death fungus stuff just appears out of nowhere, swarms the droids and ruins the game. i'd love to give this game a huge thumbs up but right now it's just a shame that these issues make it a bit dull and unplayable at times. these can be fixed by the devs surely?",0

"this is an experience, not a game. this game makes me feel like i am on the verge of cumming whenever i see an object crash in to my beautiful mountain. whenever i see an object fly past my mountain i cry a thousand rivers and mourn for the loss of my dear object. this experience has opened my eyes on how i live my life, and for anyone calling it a waste of p you need to rethink your past decisions in life. i rate this out of and i recommend anyone to buy this game. if you are a crack addict, it will turn you in to a believer of the lord and saviour. peace my brothers, good luck on the mountain.",1
this game is not only expesive but also poorly designed and sorely lacking in animation quality. p.s. don't even use the diskspace for the free weekend it's not worth it.,0

"the game itself was cool, needed a bit of a progression system but was still fun. thing is, the devs were like 'we know what's missing and will deliver a huge patch called 'the recode'' and it's been announced today that this 'recode', which should have been an update, is finally called 'primal carnage extinction' and is a full game.. to sum things up, this game is the beta test for primal carnage extinction, previously known as 'the recode'. and won't probably be played anymore in novembre, for pce gets out. i do not feel scammed, because i did not buy the game for the recode. but hype on a free recode to finally make it pay and you get my nay.",0

"this really is an addicting strategy game, and one of the best i've ever played. it has an interesting gameplay system and a fun multiplayer section. while it may be an old game by now, it still has the useful replayable feature. pros - addicting, and the urge to keep playing in order to win is always there. - different playstyles as different people, according to how you want to play. - mods section which allows you to customize your game using the steam workshop. cons - ai which can be really irksome, especially in the multiplayer section. leave them for minutes and all your money's gone. - a tutorial system would be really handy, as for some new players it can be hard to get used to. overall i would give this game a out of , as while it can be fun to play, there are still some features that need some work.",1

"oh god.. well i saw this game, and i thought it would be a good game, because its made by the people who made webkinz. and nope. its an mmo where you run around and do lame quests, and of course, blow your money! steam users be careful when you play this, because all this game does is it lures you into buying stuff with real money that you dont want or need, but you still do it instead. if anybody else likes this game, thats perfectly fine, but this is not a real mmo that i thought this game would have.",0
"if you are a millitary nut or a hardcore bf nut arma is a no thinker, this is one of the best games that i'v had the plesure of playng this year, the developer poured there love and enery into this game and with workshop adding in more guns modes ect it will continue to wow.",1

"a very basic vertical scrolling shoot em up that relies heavily on memes and throwing random things at you as its main feature. the controls are okay, there is no variation in enemies or even bosses as all normal enemies just come vertically down the screen, nothing fires at you. the bosses are a bit different in the stay on screen until destroy and wobble about trying to back you into a corner with the normal enemies that keep coming during the boss fights. each stage will have a new shaped enemy and boss but the all behave the same way throughout the game, so there is little variation. there are a few different bonuses to pick up - allowing you to fly faster, shooter faster or triple shot, etc., but apart from that there is no real depth here, and nothing really to recommend it unless you are easily amused by the memes randomness thrown at you.",0
i like this more then dod source becuse ther is more army's that you can play as. more gun's. my fav ww game ever. but dod has no radolls and all so has old phys due to the goldscr engine.,1

"breaking is fun. i have no clue if the story is good or not. it may be a masterpiece written by a descendant of shakespear. no idea. as soon as you put hammer to wall in this game, all else fades away. the environmental damage system is the best i've ever seen. it's so satisfying to break down walls of a building until it finally falls. or just to drive a truck through a village. through the village. the last time i saw a damage system that was even a smidge on the same level was way back in carmageddon and . it's basically a gta style game so you can very easily be distracted by what's going on in the world.. and then breaking whatever it is that's going on in the world.",1

"fantastic gameplay. however that doesn't matter at it takes forever to find a match, after about minutes of waiting you get into a laggy game where characters teleport around. even if you do get a good game you have had to wait forever to get it. ai matchs are either stupidly easy or unfair as the ai mind reads all your moves . clearly rushed out before it was finished for the capcom cup. give it months or so, when various updates should have fixed some of the issues that plague the game.",0
"this game is very good in my opinion - although very grindy. i grew up playing this game, i even took part of the open beta testing phase where the game was unknown to most. thoughout that time, i have come to love its features, however there are some interesting mechanics which i understand why people may find it difficult to play. other than that, it's pretty good. . out of",1

"not a bad game overall, but i think it might have come out of early access a bit too soon. certain gameplay mechanics don't seem to be fully fleshed out, and recent posts from the dev would seem to indicate that there are some significant overhauls coming in the future. i'm left with the sense after playing through the entirety of this first episode that the game is functional but very much incomplete. i'd also note that the decision to make this an episodic release leads to a very abrupt ending which only adds to the disappointment. if the game is finished and polished a bit i might change my recommendation, but in the meantime this is a thumbs down.",0
"pretty boring, to be honest. it has a decent story but it just wasn't very much fun to play.",0
its a goos game at most few gameplay mechanic are broken but its good.,1

"amazing game. for what it is, this was one of my favorite games ever when i was a kid. i am so glad i found it on steam so i can play it again. its probably one of those things where i hype it up cuz i have such fond memories of it, but so far i am not being dissapointed. definite recomendation. pretty linear, not open world or anything, but then again it is an older game and its to be expected. good combat system.",1

"i'd had my eye on this for a little while, and seeing that it was on sale, i thought that i'd go for it. the videos looked good and the screenshots did too. i realised that this was a comedy game before purchase and once it had d l i was straight in. first thoughts were 'wow, i'm a goat! i can butt things shoot lightning and bounce' i then had the realisation that i wasn't having fun. maybe i didn't give it enought time, maybe i'm a grumpy old git, but this really wasn't for me. i didn't really care for it, i was bored of it and, for me, it had no future. people adore this game, and i completely see their point of view. but, before you purchase just remember that it is a goat, making things explode and hitting people etc. if this can keep you going for hours and hours then buy, but if not i'd avoid. cheers",0

honestly really liking this gmae so far. basicaly a perfect mix between hearthstone and really good pixel art.,1
"the most aggrivating game i've played all year. the combat is so dodgy and wonky, it is not uncommon to get randomly shot and killed instantly by freshly spawned enemies as youre making your way through the linear storyline, and with checkpoints being roughly minutes apart usually, its annoying at best. i thought this game would be open world, the only open world experience you get in this is when you drive around town with your speedlimiter on because cops are everywhere going from chapter mission to chapter mission. what i personally found the absolute most irritating was that you lose your cash times in the game, as scripted with no way to stop this . it does have pretty good graphics for such an old game. but if you're too dumb to find breasts on the internet, you can always collect the playboy magazines in the game scattered as collectibles. stay away from this, even in a sale the community will defend this title to the death because 'story' and while i do admit it has a rather well done story, it does not make the game good.",0
a good zombie game for those who loves to play online or multiplayer with someone,1
i glitched out and i cant play the game it says that you have already use the code for the game then i glitch out and it did not work,0
the game is good but the price is not worth it anymore not even when its on sale unless it actually drops bellow euros the only thing worth from this anymore its only the singleplayer i would love to have some good multiplayer servers but the community is most likely dead the servers are either mods or filled with bot pluggins and the bots dont really help the game they just make it less fun,0

"i cannot recommend this game at the current price tag.. as with all musou games clones spin offs etc. gameplay is extremely repetitive. it started really nicely with a dragon boss in the beginning, which tickled a little bit of monster hunter in me but quickly got replaced by mundane less cool looking behaving mobs which i had to plow through.. game has a some combat depth with dodging and blocking but it is totally wrecked by a huge amount of enemies on the levels. i would have prefered more exploration and slower less 'flashy' combat.. i mean the assets are there. cool characters, graphics, design of weapons etc. but it doesn't keep my attention for long because its a shallow experience.. its a shame really.. it's not a dungeon experience which i hoped for this game to have but its a dynasty warriors clone with a different skin on it. you find one combo that works spam it till the end of the day get some chinese buns to recover health because u can find plenty on the battlefield so u dont need to dodge or block too much..",0

if you buy the game now you get the dlc free i was one of the first people to buy this game and i payed and now your telling me i have played longer and supported the game longer but you give it to the new guy its like working at a company for years trying to get a promo and the guy who has not even worked a week gets promoted above you even tho you worked harder this is a ing slap in the face the game is still fun buy it. im just off becsue you know,0
"ahhh payday a game i happily bought all the dlc for and played for hundreds of hours.. then they added microtransactions. microtransactions are cancerous and are killing the gaming industry, by buying this game you are supporting developers who lied to their consumers and are doing their part to destroy the gaming industry. overkills actions are sickening and wrong. i can not tell someone this game is worth their hard earned money as the developers are happy to lie to you as their studio goes downhill more and more.",0
"despite having seen that this game got mixed reviews and even reading the negative ones, my better judgement was nowhere to be found when i bought this game. while it is an updated release that is affably in continuance of the original genesis series, it lacks the same gameplay. a metric tonne fat kid running from broccoli would be faster than sonic is in this game. scratch that, here's a better remark- i could get a cv to speed faster than sonic! in its defence, however, the levels are non-linear, many of the old sounds have been tweaked a bit for higher fidelity and, the in-level baddies actually serve as decent trip-ups as you lumber down the hills like the giant boulder of death. i like what they tried to achieve but, they would've been better off making it more like the races from sonic adventure .",0
very fun game graphic are outdated as the game is old but you will still play for hours upon end dont buy rome its buggy,1

"honestly, though i like this game. it's just a litteral rip off of agar.io. skins, theme, most settings, gameplay, mechanics, etc. even the io of agar.io mitos.is is used when it obviously shouldn't have been. please devs, don't try to mooch off of other games just adding more game modes, updated graphics, equipment and music. ----- edit since people have decided to complain about this, i'd like to note i didn't say it was worse than agar.io, i said it was a rip off. edit its crazy how mad people are getting over a worthless review on the internet. if you don't like my review, don't bother complaining about it, thanks again.",0
"just..wow overkill..first then crime fest if those dont know what i am talking about its abhorrent. i was okay with the dlc i can understand that peopel need cash but this this was painful i cant recomend this game anymore this hurt me to much i cried over how far they fell.. edit going to keep the top part as a standing of what they have done so we dont forget, but they have fixed things to an extent. the new update coming out says that safes will now not need a drill to open so good. they seemed to have really learned there lesson. now that they fully own the payday brand this means the spotlight is now on them fully. so if they do something horrible it will be all on them. so congrats overkill you won me back i recomend this again.",1
"nice quality art. the included digital dakimakura enticed me to purchase this version for the play length, there were a decent amount of cgs with many variations - plot is very simple, but doesn't go anywhere is not explored in depth - refreshing personality for an otome mc tsundere princess who does exhibit growth. most people would probably find her annoying, however she outshined any other character. - pretty short with only routes. the card drops took longer than completing the entire game - romance felt flat. the male love interests have no depth. - the first version of this game was free and voiced. i played that version before they removed it i might recommended this if it were on sale and you need another basic otome game in your catalog. i decided not to recommend this because i do not like winged cloud's actions as a company. they treated their other otome game, 'guardian's spell' and it's kickstarter backers so poorly that it has left a negative impression on me.",0

"charming platform puzzle game. most puzzles involve changing between two characters to help each other progress each stage. between the puzzles and narration, gameplay was simply a lot of walking right and jumping. the story was very simple but cute. the artistic effects were also well done for an indie game. however, controls were very sluggish and there were times where i got frustrated by responsiveness when turning and jumping. foxtale dlc was very short.. and introduced two new mechanics, one of which was paddling which quickly turned into a chore. the other was simply picking up stuff and throwing it. story again was very simple and short. very short dlc. out of . overall never alone has a lot of charm in it's story and characters.. but fails to deliver in the gameplay. . out of",1

"a brilliant, beautiful puzzle game that's all about perspective, careful observation of the environment around you, and thinking outside the box. the thoughtful craftsmanship of every element of gameplay mechanics and overall concept is really impressive, alongside the gorgeous world design. having a pencil and note paper at hand is strongly recommended. important there is no 'storyline' in this game. it's purely about discovering puzzles and accumulating the knowledge you need to solve them by exploring the island. if simply the reward of working out solutions to puzzles isn't enough reason for you to play this type of game, then you may find your enjoyment of the witness lacking.",1

"ive played this since its release on xbox , the first one. this is a great gameplay, well above todays standard, and infinite above ubisoft s current standard. the story is well enough to fill its purpose",1
this game i honestly a really good game but in the end this game left me dissapointed in the spect that im playing by myself getting into the lore rping here and there i use a humanity to summon and npc to help me fight a boss and i'm invaded by some over equiped strength only knight or glass cannon mage on my way to the boss! losing my hard earned humantiy which is kinda hard to come by and it just becomes repative. a constant system of ruining other peoples playthroughs and getting nothing in reward,0

"currently all servers are offline and have been for months. i will update this review when they servers are back online. granted, the devs seem to be working very hard on the project. money well spent.",0

"great game with lots of mod support. graphics are a little outdated but can be polished up a bit with the mods. go to the nexus forum and get mod organizer and read up on what the essentials are for getting a stable game. it is a little bit of work but once you've modded it, it is a blast. imo key mods to have are mod organizer fnv gb exe. loot fnvedit everything else is icing on your cake.",1
never buy a rockstar game from steam. its useless and not working in windows . everynow and then crashing. even pirated version downloaded from internet are working better than this version. you have to do an adventure to make game load itself.,0

". out of fun game, it isn't a game that you will be playing for days straight for hours and hours but can give enough time to have fun with it. the fact that it also is on steam and is mod compatable is amazing. i highly recommend this game to anyone that likes indie games",1

"the witness is an absolutely beautiful game with a deceptively simple premise that makes for some of the most satisfying puzzles i've seen in any game. exploring the island, whether to find new puzzles or just gaze at the incredible art direction is surreal. unless you utterly despise puzzles, this is a must play.",1
this is like somebody's bizzare dream.. i very much enjoyed it.,1
"one of the best indie games i've played so far. incredibly simple yet also chock full of tiny details, with a narrative that's disturbing and intriguing. the only shortcomings are the occasional bug or glitch, and some loose story threads that could and should have been tied up, but it has the additional effect of leaving you wanting more. if you haven't done so, play hotline miami.",1

"this game surprised me. if you like guns and dinosaurs, this is the game for you. out of would do.",1
"simply put they removed too many elements from the previous game like sanity and need for oil. this made the game far too simple for me to enjoy,you could not 'explore' like you could in the previos game,you were always sent on a linear path with no freedom to do things as before like throw things into a pot of acid.all containers were sealed so you could not go and find many supplies and all around the enemies were nowhere near as frightening as the gatherers you faced before. on a scale of to on being a scary game i give it a out of ,it had potential from the previous game but was stripped to the bare bones and made less fun and scary to more boring and tedious.",0
the best tactical shooter for battlefield and cod lovers. it has a realistic sideand an arcade side. great game out of,1

just not a fan i dont really see a point in playing this game when you have minecraft or even rust and the forest coming out very soon,0
"first of all i have played this game on an other computer explains low play time and only installed it to tell you.. this game is full of people who call you a feeder and try their hardest to reported you. this is a great game with the most disrepectful players i have ever met, if you can handle getting reported every single game i recommend it.",0
this game is t don't play this !!,0
for a free game it sucks,0
out of . i dont reccomend it to people who suffer from autism.,1
"this game is good, if it was in beta! cant alt tab returning to black screen. zombies get stuck too often on corners, walls, trees.. but most horific thing is about the server searching. somebody should get a b- at elementary school for that project. the best thing is after min of searching you get the 'join server' option and it is full! and you need to start over ffs! spent out of of my time in this game at server searching. i would recommend it after it gets f p because only then you would get the value for money or time wasted on it.",0
freezes at last boss c,0
"this game is a mess. a huge mess. when i first installed this game, i saw it's voxel graphics and rpg gameplay, and thought it would be good. but the actual game is just the same thing over and over, aaannnd guess what that is. grinding. the whole game is just a grind for the sake of a grind. personally, i absolutely hate grinds. and its not like diablo or maybe borderlands, where you get good loot constantly. it's almost always a cool looking mask with horrible stats or a horrible looking mask with bad stats. i hate this game, there's just no substance or purpose. and then of course, as a cherry on top, you can bypass about a third of the grind with dlc, so you can grind even more, but, your slightly cooler looking! don't waste your valuable time on this game.",0
"this game got a lot of praise when it came out, but in reality it's just a weak loot whoring simulator with unsatisfying gameplay. warframe is the same loot simulator but far better and with a far beter community. avoid.",0
out of would fap again,1
this game is so addictive ! btr wif frens,1
a simple but well crafted stratigy game. a true pleasure to play.,1
"why do so many people say this game is a ripoff of minecraft? they're nothing alike, and terraria is better for a lot of reasons. like the bosses, they are all really fun and exciting to fight. the 'biomes' are very different from each other e.g. underworld and the hallow, completely different . the music is also very nice. there are many references to other video games minecraft, earthbound, e.g. and other references to paintings and horror movies. the devs relogic really put everything into each update and take time to spoon feed you information about the game. so really, terraria should get more attention than minecraft ever has. out of literally, perfect score",1
i would rather wipe my with barbed wire than play another second of this.,0
the game is just amazing.. the graphics for are amazing.. the story is well done.. combat is amazing.. out of,1
worth killing time to. interesting combat and character creation systems.,1
"i got the original title and i was greatly satisfied with the game, when i heard that they were revamping the game into directors cut i was pretty exited, and if you already own the original dxhr then you get a discount. i really havn't played many other games that are as in depth of an rpg as this is exept mabey mass effect or deus ex , an amazing soundtrack that fits perfectly with the gameplay and alot of stealth missions, that said if you suck at splinter cell or theif than you'll probably suck at this. either way i recomend this game for veteran fps players or beginner stealth players.",1
"very nice game, but empty and snipers are op.",1
"best game ever and i've bought it this many times original pc and xbox, steam, android",1
can't even log in very horribly made server keeps saying ''server queue estimated wait time less than a minute'' then you wait minutes and fail to log in so you have to wait in another server queue..guys if you dont know how to make a game..dont do it i definently dont reccomend this,0
"it's an ok game, but it really doesn't deserve the praise it's recieved.",0
"amazing game driven by a truly captivating plot. the characters are very dynamic and show how people would react in those situations. clearly lots of effort put in by the devs, as there are tons of areas and items that are hidden throughout the game. very solid and fun shooting mechanics as well as upgrade system. the graphics were definitely awe-inspiring at points and went well with bj's inner monologue. all in all, wolfenstein is an well-made, extremely captivating, immersive game. out of",1
"i was too scared to even do anything, just hide in something and wait and pray that dont come in for me. after exactly m, i finally have the gut to turn off the game. if someone told me im a coward for doing that, out of would do it again",1
i would say yes but this game isn't something i would recommend. it has no sound and some of the puzzles are only able to be beaten by utter luck. my favourite puzzle was trying to get it to start up.,0
"if you have a good computer get it, if not dont lags worse then ac",0
"rayman legends is a thing of beauty! if you ever enjoyed d platform gaming like super mario bros, or donkey kong country you simply can't go wrong with this game. i would even go so far as to say this game is better. the controls are very fluid and soon become second nature. which is just as well because after a few easy introductionary levels the difficulty picks up. it's all very nicely balanced, though. levels that may seem impossible at first become feasible and you'll find yourself zipping through them. the feeling of satisfaction when you're conquering another world is a joy. the tunes are memorable. you'll find yourself humming them. the graphics are poetry in motion. check the trailer and you'll see what i mean. if there's any drawback to this game i have well over hours playtime in this and my kids and about hours between them it's the lack of a coherent story. but really, who needs a story to a game like this? princess toadstool has been kidnapped by bowser time and time again without any formal complaint. if you're into platformers, grab this game! you won't be disappointed.",1
"it's tough to recommend this game unless you really like these 'twitchy arcade' style games. i wanted to know what all the fuss was about and picked hotline miami up when it was cheap. i completed the main story and i guess i'm missing something, i don't see what's so special about it. the soundtrack is great, and the look and feel of the game is its' own. my biggest complaint is how ridiculous the controls are and how unavoidable and frustrating the mechanics are during boss encounters. you'll also run into deaths that are not brought on by difficulty and they are completely out of your control. ex. an enemy you can't even see on screen will be able to take you out from across the map. melee weapons not connecting with ai on occassions. instead of the game being difficult, it seems to just come down to how lucky you are and if all the ai are lined up just right. don't pay full price for hotline miami unless you really like these types of games. pick it up when it goes on sale if you're really wanting to try it out.",0
simular to civ but not as fun.,0

literally the worst game ever.,0
"if you were expecting a an arcade simulation hybrid or a semi-pro simulation.. this isnt it. it is very arcade'y. after playing gtr , shift , iracing, hell even the first grid.. grid was wayyyy to easy. as a sim fan i was driving passively thinking about what coffee i should brew once the race was over unlike a proper sim where you actually sweat and dare not lose focus! oh and i almost forgot.. no cockpit view.. like what.. seriously.. whaaaaatttt?? visuals are beautiful though. and if you like some fun arcade racing.. go for it.",0
this is an awesome game. its got a lot of jump scares. the only down side is i can't play it much on my computer because of all the glitches.,1
why cant i move.. wtf?,0
"i just want to play this game without the lag or crashes i know there not going to fix it but if there is anyway that someone could create a patch for this it would be well worth it, i dont see why they gave no s about this game and its franchise as both are extremely enjoyable its a real shame",0
"a personal favorite of mine from the ps , and am glad to see it here. that being said there are, of course, some negatives. the video can be choppy, with mild almost unnoticeable breaks in flow. the only real complaint i have is that the audio options are unconfigurable. i have to switch my speaker settings from . surround to stereo in order to hear the voices during cut scenes if you are not familiar with final fantasy..there are quite a bit . but all in all i still find this version very enjoyable, and definitely nice to play with a controller instead of yelling at the mouse and keyboard.",1
"a very unique experience, you control two brothers on a journey to save their sick father. controlling two characters at once with one controller was a bit weird at first but you get used to it as you explore a sadly beautiful world on your quest. the story is very depressing but still has some touching moments. give it a shot if you want to try something different. . out of",1
awesome game! lots of replay-ability!,1
"no, just no. gameplay is horid.",0
easily one of the best games i have ever played. ive played a lot of games,1
good platform for something i never knew i was wanting. look forward to the mod support!,1
"this game was a complete waste of time and money. the story is uninteresting and has countless plot holes in it, and none of the characters are detailed or interesting. the so called next gen graphics pretty much only looked nice on the vehicle you are driving. i ran the game on a gb amd r x, yet the game still stuttered and looked ugly. to top it off, the game is in forced constant multiplayer mode, which means that you can not run the game offline, which would be fine except for the fact that the servers are ridiculously slow, and that there is next to nothing you can do with other players. out of .",0
"i played this game quite a bit on the ipad. tried it on the pc, thinking i could link my game to both devices. that never worked for me and playing separate games felt like a waste. i enjoyed the game a bit until i realised how pointless upgrading is. if you get a better pistol, the enemy gets the same one. if you buy a sniper, the enemy gets a sniper. buy a med kit, meet a med kit. what's the point, then? most missions are easiest with the starter gear, since the ai seem to utilize then less effectively. in the end i just didn't bother.",0
"despite all my time playing this game, i was really done at minutes. this game is intentionally an unplayable mess. countless crashes, clipping, audio-visual hiccups, physics mishaps, and more pollute this game. the game feels rather dull with only two maps you can run through in about an hour. the 'game changing'power ups aren't any better. omg u gota tri jtpak gote! except jetpack goat, along with the rest of this , is unplayably buggy, lame, and gets boring within minutes. do not buy this game unless you are severely inebriated before purchase",0
the best thing to do in this game in my opinion is to get - friends to join you on an empty killbox server and use gravity guns only.. the joy of killing your friend with a toilet bowl.. its glorious,1
awesome game from desktop to web to android out of would capitalise again,1
"after one hour i can say only that this game is boring..very very very boring. you go from place to place, you fight with enemies by clicking left or right mouse button. i do not 'feel' this game. it does not say to me 'play with me' it says more like 'this is all i have'.",0
"great single-player, but multiplayer is good as dead, i recomment buying when on sale together with the first cod and cod",1
a peice of the combat is stupid people can hit me when im shielding,0
"worst game i have played in a long time, felt sick, too much spinning for no reason, it flys like a plane and not like a space ship, tutorials are useless, the landing tutorial gives you glowing lines but nothing else, you have absolutly ideas what to do from that point, aiming systems..wow felt like an old arcade game, ship flys forward and shoots forward. not impressed at all and would not recomend anyone to buy",0

"despite buying this game, i'm locked out due to lousy drm. be careful if you buy.",0
"the game is beatiful, it's that deus ex sequel many of us waited for, except for the one thing. and that's the main reason why i give a negative review - microtransations in aaa title? are you kidding me? this is beyound good and evil, this is pure corporate greed and this must be stopped. i won't be buying any of square enix games any more unless this is taken down. update now hours later i still can say that game is fantastic, such a pity i can't upvote it for reasons above. p.s. about low perfomance - for one use taa instead of msaa. and if it doesn't help read this guide",0
"side note i have considerably more hours on the console version of this game, only recently picking up the pc version one of the most destructive and explosive sandboxes around. a game based purely on blowing things up and having a good time, just cause understands perfectly what most people playing an open world game want to do. also, amazingly optimized for such a good looking game.",1

"out of i've always been a fan of the total war francise and i'm pretty sure everyone was disapointed by rome . and yes, attila is basically the same setting as rome barbarian invation. but the game itself is actually fairly decent with almost all problems from rome fixed. there are of course some drawbacks, such as the lack of multiple voices in the game in diplomacy, as well as a limited amount of actual factions to play as. plus having to pay to get more factions through the dlcs? that was bs, move ca. all in all the game isnt so bad providing new features and a major graphics boost, as well as fun gameplay and the return of the family tree. i would recommend it to any total war fan, but shogun is still my favorite",1
"this game is like the best game i've ever played, wouldn't work for the first couple weeks tho but once it started working i couldn't stop playing it. unfortunetly in the tutorial it doesn't specifie that you need to complete all the quests before you can go to the other side.",1
"campaign is super awesome, action is amasing and excutions are lovely! defenetly one of best fps games!",1

"only thing i can say about this is..i want another campaign, not a crappy sequel! this game is amazing. get it now. out of",1

"crayon physics is a sandbox where you draw objects and have the physics engine move them around. the game aspect of it is that there are levels where you need to get a ball to touch the stars in a level. as a game, crayon physics fails on most levels. it's far too easy, and the same solutions work on most of the puzzles, making it very repetitive. the music and sound is very basic. 'winning' crayon physics is as boring as it is pointless. as a physics sandbox, it's too basic for my tastes. i'm sure there are cool things you can do, but they would take far too much effort to do with the limited toolbox you're given. why can't we make motors? i'd love that. or at least make the ropes actually work. or maybe i'm missing something.. the tutorial is amazingly bad. if you want to draw cool stuff and watch it go, then sure, pick up crayon physics. i'll spend the time playing games instead. either way, do not spend on this.. wait until it's on sale.",0

"first time i didn't expected to have a lot of fun out of this game. however, i realized that this game offers gamers to enjoy the game in a long term. unlike any other games that are only enjoyable for a short period. i played many shooters but this one this one of games that you should try out. i recommend to buy this game when it is on sale and you also need a decent computer to play this game.",1
"i wanted to like this game it has nice graphics, plays familiarly, and has a good atmosphere. the problem is, i can pretty much describe that the same way about a lot of games on the market eos really doesn't bring anything new to the genre. developers need to stop being 'the world of warcraft killer' especially for those of us who could care less about wow and come up with something new and wonderful.",0

"alright, conclusion is done and dusted. conclusion itself is basically a very short walking simulator. some of the steam reviews claim it took minutes to complete. that is definitely not tru. you simply cant alk fast enough in the game for that to be a reality. about a half hour with examining all the items and taking in some scenery is more accurate. story",0
"played civ and fell in love, years later and many lost hours, i still do. this however is not that game. beyond earth is a great idea, but has many missing peices that made civ so monumental. all the factions pretty much feel the same, the ai has a lame personality and attitude. the idea of bringing in a new world with alien was great but gets annoying quick as you blaze down the little buggers. diplomacy is like dealing with the dmv, might as well punch yourself in the face. so a great idea and maybe in the future it will get better but right now if you want to try a civ game turn right around and saddle up with civ",0

guns of icarus is a good game a mix between co-op and pvp. the game encourages you to bring friends along to play with you. the game lets you take on roles to keep your airship in battle. what makes guns of icarus so good in my opinion - theres airships to choose from each with their own weaknesses and strengths - theres a wide variety of guns to choose from from gattling guns to flare guns to mines - not many people in guns of icarus are toxic in my opinion that i have seen. making it easier since the community is helpful and friendly. especially if you have voice chat they will be very happy to help there isnt a lot of bad things in this game and a lot of it isnt really much of a big deal. this game is not buggy so i really think its a good job. out of,1

this game is no longer worth the purchase due to the drm requirments for 'games for windows live' as someone who loved the game in the past i am exceedingly dissapointed i can no longer play it without massive fixes to router ports and additional ridiculiouse problems caused by the drm process. when i purchase a game through steam this shouldn't happen honestly.,0

this is what fun is not.,0
"this is an rts. sorta.. more realistic than what i would believe a game should be. instead of the a-typical select units, tell units to go attack in a flank formation, command mid-battle to turn the tide, etc, etc- it's more of a system to entice your units into what you want them to do. you set a reward on a monster, and then put a bounty on it's head. that is an amazingly cool idea- but in practice it doesn't work out so well. i had set my flag, and set the bounty to . no one would go kill this monster.. i set the bounty to , nothing. finally around the more than a out of of all the money i had available mark someone wanted to try it. they promptly died, so one more decided to try it. they died. there isn't really a symbolence of strategy here as i watched each unit die to just one, the very first at that, monster. at , i finally got more than one unit to go and they spent more time running away together than fighting. and for out of of my kingdom- it was awful.",0
"finished the story in about hours and i enjoyed it. it's got great graphics, really good controls and a pretty compelling story with well-acted characters. it also provides you with a pretty big variety of options for difficulty. i played it on the easiest setting and in places it felt more like a cover shooter than a stealth game, which is a-ok with me.",1

"a married beatnick couple battle squares everywhere on both sides of the wall to get one of 'em outta jail and hopefully score the rumoured heist loot. bought on sale and with that in mind, i recommend it for fans of classic point and click adventuring. somewhat short i'd say less than hours on a decent 'check everything' playthrough , but well-written and entertaining most of the way through. easy and logical puzzles, so none of that 'put the frog in the mouth of your younger self on a park bench' a'la the first discworld game. there's no punishment for trying out the wrong things if something goes wrong, you'll be right back to 'just before making a wrong decision' , but the occasional saving is recommended as some parts present different solutions with slightly different outcome for the storyline. sure, there's some clunky animations and the occasional audio mishap, but nothing that detracts from neither gameplay nor atmosphere. if such things matter deeply to you, there's always the first zork game to keep you up at night. replay value is limited, but on the whole, i enjoyed the ride while it lasted.",1
"such lush scenery in a nice, relaxing atmosphere all joking aside, if you are the kind of person who enjoys exploring environments, feeling the mood, the atmosphere, the visual and sound immersion and feel moving around in pretty landscapes is its own reward, regardless of whichever brownie points a game might give you for exploring, you will find this gratifying. i just.. definitely did not expect getting creeped out as often as i did, neither from the screenshots nor from the reviews. but it's very mild, even for someone like me who gets scared extremely, embarrassingly easily, and it does add to the experience. there is a lot of detail and thought put into processing things with your senses. i found it surprising how well the game manages to communicate other types of sensory input via sight and sound only for instance, looking at directly at the sun is very uncomfortable and something you'll find yourself avoiding doing, same with messing with a swarm of bees. the transitions in sound are very subtle yet effective, and feels like part of a coherent whole. if feeling an environment isn't your thing, don't buy it. otherwise it's worth it.",1
my computer crashes whan i play the game and i cannot return it,0

"i originally had this as a thumbs up, but after playing it came to the realization that, while it is a good game, it is nowhere as good as the original. the single player campaign is lacking, and it seems the new dlc is geared specifically toward multiplayer, whereas in the original coh you got great single player and multiplayer. and speaking of dlc, the sheer amount of it is absolutely ridiculous. i feel it's all a money grabbing scheme. definately wait for a good sale.",0

"i have had a love for trains since i was a child and own a few different versions of train simulator, along with other train games, but i have to say, i am a bit annoyed at the design of this current game. i am the type of person to explore and then create my own world with these games, but i was a bit shocked at the way the current game operates. the graphics and sound, scenarios, and overall gameplay is fine, but do i need to see advertisements when loading, do i need to have scenarios show up and then tell me to buy them? sure, its fine to promote dlc, but do it in a sub menu or somewhere else. i feel like i purchased advertisment spam more than a game. now comes editing. seriously need to rework the key bindings here and make it a default for zoom to the mouse scroll. arrow keys vs. the wasd common movement assignments? really! i'm sorry, but honestly i can't see myself enjoying this version over previous ones. i hope my opinion changes as i play, but first impressions leave it a bit low..",0

"this is not a negative review, i just really do not recommend buying it as it currently is. this game is great, it is a lot of fun and has so much replayability. the this is though the networking and servers for this game are terrible. it takes way too long to join a game and once you are in one you better hope the host doesn't leave. not only that the nat settings are crazy, i had to forward so many ports for this game to work and now for some reason. even though i have changed nothing, my nat setting is back to 'strict' instead of 'open' meaning i can not play online. edit out of - to be able to get your nat type from strict to open you must go into your router settings everytime you want to play and disable and re-enable upnp. on a side note, not very many people play terrorist hunt mode anymore, some still do but on normal difficulty only. there are still plenty of people who play online however.",0
"i'm so sad that a game that i have invested my time and effort this much had become so cluttered with stupid new update. the new hud looks so cluttered yet shows the half of the information the old hud showed. and all the information needed is so smal that u need to get closer to the screen to see. i used to love this game but now i spent the quarter of the time i used to play and it is getting even smaller, maybe thats a good thing. i used to buy items form the shops within seconds. i used to see my stats easily. i used to enjoy my loading screens and hud skins. i didnt have to come closer to the screen to see base damage attack speed and movement speed. long story short the new ui sucks and made the game so unplayable and unenjoyable. it feels like wearing my comfiest favorite shoes on the wrong feet. hope they will make a legacy hud option avaiable soon.",0

"alright. i was super hped about this game. i'd spent a while watching gamepay and playing the mobile game, so when i got it, i was quite excited. however, the second i jumped into actual gameplay, the entire game refused to go past fps. to this day, the problem is unfixed after numerous patches, and the game runs smooth, but it is all so slow, and not in the laggy way. i want to recomend the game, as the gameplay and combat is fun, but until this issue is fixed, i can't recommend this game.",0
"you never have enough control of your units. survivors and zombies are just colored dots. the game has very basic design flaws, like switching which mouse button moves your units between the planning and action phases. is basic consistency too much to ask for?",0

it's a really fun game because it is not to hard but it can be played with freinds,1
"very good game! first the graphics are really nice! the are some really good textures, especially for the main characters. i really liked the story! a good twist and lots of cool encounters and surprises. the combat system is very interesting, because it is a 'one button' combat system with blocking that seems really simplistic, but when you stop smashing the attack button and start to aim where you are attacking it takes you to a whole other level of depth. i got a solid hours, without searching for all the collectibles, challenges, and resolving riddles. so if you add on all that you swing around h to hours of good gameplay! i recommend this game to all fans of batman!",1
"plus fantastic world, many parts of it will remind you of half life no doubt. open world where you can reach almost any place and can take different paths to your objectives. challenge yourself to finish objectives without being seen or being alerted. upgrade weapons and abilities. collect charms and runes to gain edge over your opponents. minus very very short single player experience, not worth bucks. only chapters and they will end quickly. no game mode w all the powers you get. question a stealth game where you can't shoot out lights w your gun or explosive? who came up w that idea of bulletproof lights!! why fps games have to be so short?",1

"reminds me a lot of unreal tournament, except the weapons can be mixed around to act like any given standard gun assault rifle, shotgun, laser, rocket launcher, etc. and with a variety of effects. not quite as amazing as it may sound, but it is pretty nice. to get enough game credits to truly customize your ideal pair of guns, you're gonna need to grind though. there's not really any pay to win, but that doesn't mean you can't save yourself a chunk of time by throwing money at the screen. that's how free to plays work. not bad for another team, multiplayer, shooter arena game. i like that's it's third person better immersion and fov . but, ehhh. out of",0
"expensive, too slow, hard to follow and very complicated. the time it takes the ai to move is very irritating, the time it takes the forces to move in a battle is very frustrating. to be able to see the progress and follow the evolution of the city building is so convoluted it makes me just want to scream. the graphics are better but i preffer to have the simplicity and less bells and whistles. unlike the first rome which was simpler, quicker and alot less complicated. much easier to visualize, understand, follow and progress to more advanced levels. don't recommend it for the casual gamer. not worth it for me. i wish i could get my money back.",0
"painfully easy and repetitive, save for a few encounters. which is really disappointing, because the game, while quite simple in it's mechanics, has potential to be a very engaging strategy game. yet most of the time the game chooses just to throw piles of weak monsters at you which you have to slog trough without using half of a brain cell. another thing that really makes this game painful to play is that it has a bunch of unnecessary dice rolls outside combat - travel, rest, investigate.. all of these unnecessarily slow down the game without providing anything to it. i can't even recommend this as a time-sink game for your tablet or other low-powered device. additionally, while not a direct criticism to the game, i've been noticing a trend of games trying to mask poor gameplay by filling the game with humour and pop-culture references. and this game really tries hard to seem hip and cool, which just leaves a bad taste while playing it..",0
"this is a nice variation on a create-your-own-world game. the graphics are 'simple' but good. there are not a lot of monsters out to kill you, and you do not loose. the game is the world you create. this game would rock on a gear vr.",1

"'shantae and the pirate's curse' is the latest and best game released of the shantae series so far . join shantae as she teams up with the pirate risky boots to stop the spread of an ancient curse. use various pirate equipment and sail on a pirate ship as you explore several islands in sequin land. battle monsters, upgrade weapons and search labyrinths for rare treasures and items. like the previous installment, the game stands out with great music, beautiful art, solid controls, lovable characters and a memorable story that never takes itself too seriously. note that it has more content than the previous games, including an unlockable 'pirate mode', multiple endings and enough achievements to challenge even hardcore players. the only significant flaw is the lack of transformation magic and sexy dances due to the events of the previous game. i highly recommend 'shantae and the pirate's curse' to anyone who enjoys platformers like castlevania or metroid. definitely look forward to the release of the next shantae game!",1

got shot into the sky by a firework then landed on a rooftop party where i became deadgoat and rammed people off the roof. out of would lick again,1
i love this game im good at medic,1
"this was an interesting idea for a game but it just didn't really come together for me. this is in the visual novel choose your adventure style with no way to lose the game, just variations on what happens. the comic art style is interesting but not especially pleasing to look at. the story is decent, but it feels like it was translated either in a hurry or by someone who has an incomplete grasp of english. also, once you've gone through the story once, the variations are really pretty minor on subsequent playthroughs. none of the endings resonated with me. achievement hunting is fun at first, but some are way to easy to miss and replaying the game is difficult because you can't skip text you've already seen, or even cycle through it quickly. i'm missing two and it bothers my ocd but i just can't click another times to advance text.",0
"i remember my days as a kid, i had just gotten a new copy of heroes of might and magic iii, even back then that game was old. but for me it was a new fresh experience that i'd never had before, it took me about a month to reliase that i could end the turn and didn't have to make a new game each time i'd finished my moves, but when i reliased this i suddently got really into the game, i spent almost years playing that game non-stop.. ever since i've been looking for something similar, and age of wonders iii is probably the best fantasy x game i've played in recent years, it succeeds in fullfilling my nostalgia with homm and i couldn't be more happy that i bought it. a strong recommend for anyone that is even slightly interested in x games with a focus on combat, hero customization and exploring.",1
best game ive ever played,1
sherlock holmes written by hp lovecraft instead of ac doyle?,1
i bought this game thinking it was guns of icarus online hoping that i could play with my mates but the poor graphics quality made it bad even when on campain.,0
"this is unnaceptable, and i will not be changing my un-reccomendation regardless of patches or apologies. this should never have happened.",0
worst game ive ever played. i actually got some enjoyment in how it was. pro tip look down to jump off the time,0
"overall good likes - charming - somewhat puzzle-y gameplay - a good amount of recipes to discover and creatures to unlock dislikes - levels can sometimes feel like clutter management, which is frustrating - not really that random. the types of creatures you encounter are somewhat randomized, but they are also based on the difficulty difficulty increases every round year . level layouts are only somewhat varied e.g., a room might have trees instead of rocks, a special room might appear . doesn't feel that different between playthroughs. - after you've beat the game once or twice, you've pretty much seen all it has to offer",1
i can't find words for it. just amazing.,1
i cant play this game wtf !!,0
"huh.. this is the kind of game that you can easily find for free. pretty sure those free versions are way better, since this one is ugly, uninspiring, boring, and just plain bad. don't mind my playtime, i only spent minutes playing. the rest is for trading cards.",0
"pros - graphics cons - voice acting terrible - story - bad mobile port - feels so slow for an fps play it on mobile, don't bother the pc mac version.",0
"when i first started playing this game, i left a positiv review about how intriguing this game was. a steep learning curve, but rewarding when you stick through it. and yes, while this is true the game in itself is amazing , it is the community that is the downfall of this game. people are putting more focus on your choices in the game and are just waiting to jump at your first ever so slight mistake, insulting you beyond good and evil, while they themselves already lost their lane. 'the community is toxic' and old phrase that simply could not ring any truer. instead of trying to play as a team, always at least one person will do their best to screw up the game for everyone else and then even be an a hole about it. so, what you end up doing is spending minutes at a time arguing with idiots, morons, trolls, and other kind of intellectually challenged people. is this fun? no. stay away from it.",0
hard but fair game. engine works incredibly precise so picnic occurs fairly often. nothing for people with short temper.,1
i cant even remember the game but steam insists i have played it.,0
"this game is too difficult, impossible to have fun. all your soldiers will die easily moreover the ennemies have superior weapons and armor. the scenario does not exist.. very disappointed..",0
"it's a clicker game, so expect a huge amount of clicks if you want to complete the achievements. it's a fun game with a good difficult at begin, but like all the clicker games you will reach a point where clicking is unnecessary or not fun and will just leave it iddle. still a very good game with a good art and sfx. expect hours and hours of grind if you want to finish the achievements and get 'max' level on every single skill character.",1
"do not buy this game. it crashes for a lot of people, and there's no fix in sight.",0
thekinginyellow think what we're doing with our lives playing this game. it doesn't make any sense. random player dont thekinginyellow don't what? random player know out of would contemplate existential subjects again,1
i bought it uplay and i love it. so much fun and nearly no one hacks at the moment. it's still getting better and you have a long time with fun and sth. to do.,1

"not a horrible game, but disappointing at how little game time there actually is.",0
"simply amazing. after playing it i've read all the fables comics and now i appreciate the game even more, and even if you haven't read it it is very good. telltale learned from twd and just built on it. last year twd was my goty, this year this might be, even though s of twd is up there. if you love story or adventure games - get this!",1
old school trigger happy action mayhem!,1
"not what i expected at all -preordered it to play on the day, uplay wouldnt let me.. umm hang on i bought it on steam why do i have to log into uplay? here i am days later and it still fails to connect to uplay on some occasions. -driving sucks -you cant randomly smack a civilian or get behind a cop and knock them out but hey.. you can shoot everyone and run them over though. -you cant jump -the game feels really sluggish -hacked a camera, then another accross the street and then hacked into a transformer and blew it up which killed someone, somehow mgically the police knew it was me and started chasing me.. what the hell? -police where looking for me so i was walking around out the way, they drove past a few times.. i decided to get in the car i had been standing next to for about minutes and all of a sudden every cop in the area knew where i was and started rushing to me from very far away. dont buy this game, it doesnt even seems as though its half finished yet.",0
"being a fan of the original far cry, i without asking any questions, rushed through and baught this. so.. i was a little taken aback with the fact that this game is not a sequel in anyway and for the life of me i cant make any connection at all between the two. although they obviously have put some time into making the far cry world beautiful, it doesnt sparkle or shine. theres no 'oh wow, look at that scenery' moments, theres no twist in the story line, its barebones basic and not worth your trouble. id compare this game to a shiny big present a rich uncles got you, only for you to open it and find his junk.",1
this game is way better than lol even i didn't play it allot. worth it to try out!,1
"on a scale from -, i love this game",1
"iest game ever played. u no what, i wouldnt even consider it a game",0
"seriously, it went from pretty good or okay at least, to absolutely painful. the only way you can build a unique hero now is by paying the subscription. but wait theirs more! act now and you could be painfully stuck in whatever costume they decided should go with their archetypes. sure you could eventually get the costume you actually wanted by constantly randomizing the character and locking the pieces that match though! but where is the fun in creating your own hero? oh wait, you gotta pay for that fun. joy!",0
what a waste of my money. wish i could refund it. controls are terrible. explore within the time limit per level or else the ghost will kill you and you start all.over.again. dont know what the hype is all about and to say this eventhough im a fan of platform games.,0
"controlled so terribly that i gave up after minutes on the tutorial. the fact that my character kept walking through solid objects, ignored my commands and the sound intially did not work leads me to believe that the game is a buggy mess on modern hardware..at least i hope.",0
"terrible!! slow game play, dumb story, not immersive.. need i say more. i played hrs of it and i want ever minute back!",0

infestation survior stories also known as infestation shitvivor or hacker stories is the worst game known to man even minecraft and online flash player games can be this game,0
"just don't. even if this game were free getting it is a terrible idea. pros -cool concept cons -grammatical errors throughout -looks like something straight out of the s -events for individual cities are limited and incorrect -crashes often -those grammatical errors could quite possibly be killing me. this is obviously a low-budget game and is not worth the money. with that being said, if the devs update to fix errors and add things it may change my mind.",0
game hasn't aged well. community is complete and udder trash. still rather entertaining to a point.,0
"worst cod game, i'm sticking with black ops . don't waste your money on this game! too many hackers and problems joining games.",0
it's sad because a team of dedicaed game developers most likely put ther heart and soul into this game but pay win ruins the game.,0
"i can see why this game could be really offensive to some. but i think that's what sells it. rather vent all your crazy inner demons in a game, than go crazy in reality. i really enjoyed the crazy destruction, and intense fire fights. however i must say the views could be better, as there are occasions where the ai fire from off screen, making it incredibly difficult to target them. still i really enjoyed this game.",1
i've played since so i believe i have some legit grounds to review this game. in a nutshell it went from skill to pay to win real quick and now it's . hopefully the new devs from deca can help.,0
"hours wasted, should have believed the reviews.",0

perfect game!! let's put that game in place of most poupular steam games,1
crap i thought i was buying manhunt.,1
it ing sucks in all of the best ways,1
fix the ing cpu usage glitch already.,0
"i once considered this game to be of my favorite games. the graphics are tight, the game play is amazingly fun, its one of the few games on the the market that are actually play to win, and the community was fairly supportive of new players and allowed everyone to get in on the fun. but things have changed. the community is now for the most part dead and i swear that they moved all their severs to china because no matter how many games i join the lag is ever present. team deathmatch? get shot by someone as i run into a building but i dont die from it till i'm rooms in. fumigation? the canister dosen't start to be captured until about seconds of me standing around with a huge sign on my face that says shoot me!! and im not the only one with this problem too. read some of the reviews below me. until they fix this game breaking issue i'm removing this game from my library and you should reconsider adding it to yours.",0
"its games like this that make me not want to buy indie games any more. i bought the four pack hoping to play with my friends, and everytime i make a server it just says 'server shutdown' almost instantly. yes i port forwarded, yes i cleared it through my firewall, yes i verified the intergrity of my cache, no i will not ever down hamachi to play a multiplayer game! if i have to download hamachi to get multiplayer to work, then the devs messed up. bottom line, this is a broken game. -infinity",0
awesome truck simulator. once you play you can't stop.,1

"the game is fun for about an hour and thats it, nothing new, same stuff all over and over again.",0
"this game, i really cant say much about it other than that its god awful some things graphically do look good but a turd is a turd anyway you try and shine it. if you dont like quality products or your own time which i dont and its why i took the bullet for you video below id say there are some story spoilers but that would mean there was a story, this one is just alcohal. youtube video kickers day one garys incident nbsp",0
way too simple thus boring,0
fun on its own. even better with mods. probably of my playtime are modded playthroughs.,1
"the core game is a fun, challenging and competitive romp that is well worth the price of admission. and then there's the amazingly violent helicopter . out of would stare at in awe again.",1
"its good to see you. stay close to me, and don t touch anything.",1
as someone who played ro for its fun and nostalgia this is a quick fun until you get into the nitty and gritty of the clicker game itself. namely the mercenary system combined with rng which at some point will eventually turn it into a cash grab. why you ask? at some point all the options you are given will default into the death of your mercenary despite attempting to save and try to surpass it. maybe its a bug or maybe its a 'feature' i don't know but its killed all my interest and faith in the game. i will or may change my review but this remains as it is. i cannot recommend this 'game',0
not even played this game for a hour and i can say its awesome.. i get addicted to so fast lol!! download it! its free and fun,1
impressive artwork. enjoyable and witty dialogue. the 'firefly' combat system is engaging! an all around new and fun single-player rpg experience. well worth it during a steam sale!,1
first hours were awesome! then is pathetic and a loop of the same things.,0
"the bosses were cheap pieces of . the game quite literally only has four different levels. they and make two levels per planet, i'm not buying it, that's only one level. rushed and not very good. after loving the first one i had high expectations for this, crushed and destryoed my friends.",0
"as everyone has pretty much mentioned in all their reviews, the storyline was out of at best, with a lot of lore collection item collection sadly it is lacking in terms of gameplay interactions and the interface was pretty out dated comparing it to released games. don't get me wrong the game was good, but with the current price . it isnt worth it, might want to wait for some pretty good sale before buying this one.",1
"how can they release a game there isn't finished. and after, release each mission as a dlc, and force you to wait to they all come out so you can complete the game? it defies belief. i have never seen anything like that. and i play a lot of games. i'm mad as hell. and even though they only give you one mission. there are still performance issues. f ck this game.",0
great game! in my opinion not anything special gameplay wise but the game runs smooth and is a solid shooter that is extremly fun and adictive!,1
"you play as the alchemist, and you collect cds which grant you powers. you blow up waves of enemies using the alchemist's powers, and its basically a load of fun. out of , a bit short.",1
"this is really an old school rpg. a great story with several nasty twists and difficult choices to be made, non to great but functional graphics, companions with an imperfect history and their flaws for hire, challenging initiative 'turn based' combat with a tactical twist where the tide sometimes flips from utter victory to utter defeat. oh, and one other thing, be prepared to spend a lot of long hours and hours to finish it and because of this, the game progress will really have it's ups and downs . . . all in all, try and you may like it !",1
the bad the feeling ain't right not mafia,0
"really not worth your time. the idea is great, but in execution not at all. the combat is clunky, and badly designed you can stunlock anyone bosses included and can be stunlocked by anyone , the fov makes that you will not see enemies flanking you and the lock on system is so sticky that you will always have to hit and run which i can tell you is not fun at all. pair this with an unbelievable story, extremely weird world design with nothing to like about and sub-par voice acting, this game was a real pain to get through. zeno clash has absolutely no value, you will be much better off with zeno clash ii.",0
i like this game ill give it out of simply because it has no story line. but! the gameplay is still awsome and voices is awsome and worth that price.,1
"looks absolutely stunning most of the time, far better than i expected and performs a good deal better than the first game ever did for me. better draw distance, quicker loading, no stuttering, no ugly banding in skyboxes or annoying distant flickering textures. i can finally enjoy the game in a way i couldn't before and like it was meant to be enjoyed. i couldn't ask for anything better, absolutely worth it in every way over the original if you don't have it, and i'm thrilled i got it for free.",1
"another crappy game people want to like because someone told them they should, it's boring, has terrible graphics and the controls don't work as they should but that could be fixed with a patch. it's definitely different from lots of games that get released and i'm sure some people will find a reason to play it but i prefer to spend my limited free time playing good games.",0
"i kind of regret those hours on cc gw. correction i completely regret those hours. you should not get it. never. first of all, it's poorly made and has graphics used too commonly, and very little weapon variety and of the few weapons, only the lmg and smg type guns are effective the sniper rifles are somehow ing outsniped by ing lmgs. the storyline is somewhat cool.. -ish? it involves an oil crisis, and so now everyone is attempting to own sections of their own country for oil.. now that i think about, it doesn't make any sense, and i don't want it to make any sense because i ing hate this game. just get it for the tf hat, bolt action blitzer but i don't actually even like that hat.. it's free, get it if you want, don't get it if you don't need that ing hat. this game is . i think this is my record for amount of times ing swearing in a review.",0
awesome game! intersting hilarious creative.. just great lt,1
sometimes i wonder if i'll ever experience happiness again. todd howard bets i won't.,0
this game looks like so much fun but it would be fun if i could play it fps pls stop,0
only a couple minutes into the game and it already won't work just great. it was working perfectly fine up until the second portal. once i went through the second portal the screen went black and i was unable to progress. i still heard the audio of the game and the sounds of me jumping but the screen was completely black and i wasnt able to play.,0
"i love this game. i've played it about times with different iterations of characters. this game does everything right if you give it time. an excellent story, great mood, and some legendary locations the glow, the cathedral, etc. play the game that started the fallout franchise. but please, do yourself a favor don't play this with walkthrough in hand. play it like an rpg. design your character the way you want it and play the way you want to. the game lets you and you'll have a lot more fun. trust me.",1
i expected this to be like diep.io as worm.is is like slither.io however this game has a very clunky movement system and a cover system that is not necessary. i understand that this has to be its own game but it's poorly made in general.,0
"delightful voicover, solid storytelling, and puzzles that aren't too casual. minimalist but highly polished! graphics and controls. one of the most wholesome experiences i've had as a gamer.",1
solid game for a bit of hack-and-slash. you know the deal boys. turtle power boyssssssss,1
"nowhere close to the grid series, tracks are just static settings, no barrier interaction, no tracks in sand, nothing.",0
modded it so cars flew around and killed everyone.,1

this game cost twice as much when i bought it in early access. move.,1
when i try to play sheterd it just stays a white screen,0
this game is very fun to play. thr graphics are great. even if im die im still happy because you get the best animated deaths this game i recomend playing or atleast try it out. there are a couple of bugs but who cares i love it. i give this game out of . follow the guys who made this game.,1
"don't go for roguelands if you want a 'survival building' game like terraria or others the building on it is pretty simple just some customizing on your ship . this title is a roguelike 'platformer rpg' of the same developer from magicite that excels in what it does. with some different skills, lots of craftable itens, procedurally generated levels and a lot of painful permanent deaths that serve the porpouse of unlocking new races and other stuff for your new created characters this game has given me some hours of good fun. the multiplayer is also good and makes the game a lot easier as you can resurrect your downed friends. however the only form of multiplayer is connecting by ip and needs your to portforward in order to work, not that much of a trouble but could be better on this.",1
highly recommened this game. . is amazing with the new bosses and hard enemies,1
"this game although old is very fun and easy to get into. you start with of the best wpns in game and through progression obtain any weapon, car, clothing you would need to sucessful w o spending and rl money. i would recommend this to anyone who likes shooter games. i have over hours so far in the game and still enjoy it played a bit outside of steam",1
cancer weaboo game. dont buy,0
love the game. i liked it even more than nekopara vol . i really enjoy the other cat girls and there interaction with each other. i was smiling and laughing throghout the game.,1
"very very very! boring run stab run stab run stab no challenge at all seriosly me and this other person bashed each other for a good minutes and i lost about out of of my health. i have a pretty decent gaming computer and struggle to get fps some times it drops to fps - - also servers bad low ping as well. would not recommend at all i am goining to unistall it right away. the xombie a.i. just chases you and when you attack it you will almost never get hit by it, it more of less just makes noises as you hit and moves. real crappy, unistall time! . out of",0
tower defense with kinda old school graphics. personally i don't like games with bs graphics. price is too high for game like this but i can't complain - i got this for free. out of .,0
"this game when it came out back in i went out immediately to buy it from gamestop because i wanted a hard copy, since it's release they have added great dlc and we can expect more in the future. one of my favorite turn based strategies. just like i would recommend before making any purchasing of a game watch a video on youtube and get an idea if you would like to play what you're seeing in the video. i would recommend this game to really anyone it's just a great time wether you're just playing singleplayer or multiplayer.",1
"its one of those 'is it a video game, is it art?' things. its decent enough, i wouldnt pay for it and am glad that its f p.",1
"this game got dumped on by a lot of critics when it came out, and not without reason. magic is gimpy, and the most powerful tactic by far is kicking dudes into pointy things. however, the fact remains that no game has ever made first person melee combat feel so good or so smooth, not even zeno clash. it's also one of the few games that effectively combines action and stealth gameplay, so that both approaches seem worthwhile, even using both if you've spent your skillpoints appropriately. just do yourself a favor and don't bother with hardcore mode. it makes all humanoid enemies and possibly spiders invincible unless you knock them down and hit them with a coup de grace, which makes combat incredible tedious.",1
"awesome game but.. i am a mac user, i downloaded steam and tought that i could play all servers in server list. well i can't. steam gmod crashes. but i like it because i play on other servers. p bye",1
years still as good as day one!,1
"the graphics may be good in this game but, to be brutally honest, this may be passed as one of those ipad games you give to your year old to keep them occupied. even then there's not much going on on screen to keep them interested. as previewed in the freaking trailer it's literally a plane going back and forth across the screen and dropping bombs on buildings, almost like a reverse space invaders. that might sound cool but when have you looked at those things and thought they would provide riviting gameplay? you can't even move the plane on your own so the only thing you have to do is wait for your plane to fly over some buildings and spam left click. in the style of old, crappy nes games, it also provides a quite annoying loop of a soundtrack. overall, this game is only slightly more thought provoking than following a laser light around the room. ps. the graphics may be good but that doesn't mean the art style is. ie. this monstrosity",0
this game still has a multiplayer crowd. buy it it's the best one.,1
"easily one of my favorite games ever, i'm pretty sure the only game i've ever beaten more is chrono trigger and even then, that was new game as opposed to starting a new one entirely . so yes, with its numerous discounts let alone price tag, pick up this gem.",1
"this is a great game but it crashes all the time on mac. recently i discovered that some very old, crashed instances of the game never shut down and were running in the background taking up huge amounts of cpu resources.",0
do you like driving ships? do you like riding on ships? if yes then you'd like this game. the only catch is the ships are in the air and you are either the captain or the crew. the game is beautiful and the customization options are intense. if i have anything wrong with this game it's leveling up. it's not done with matches and experience from the matches it's from acheivements. if you can get pass that than buy this game!,1
"this is a great indie game which i absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of adventure or sandbox games. at first, it just seems like a d minecraft, but it's a lot more than that. you can fight bosses, find loot, play multiplayer, go mining, build huge houses, and a whole bunch more stuff. it recently got a massive new update which added so many more new things. it's definitely not worse than minecraft, and i personally reckon it's better, and plus, it's only bucks.",1
"imagine the best combination of walking dead and xcom! now imagine someone else playing that game in an adjacent room while you repaint the accent wall of the foyer from 'dusty off-white' to a nice shade of eggshell. you're going to feel really bad if you buy this game after reading that description and then realize it was completely accurate. edit update for the 'reanimated' patch it's still an incredibly tedious game, except now sometimes you'll die. but don't get me wrong it's not an awful game. it's too uninteresting to feel that strongly about it.",0
"i want to like this, but i just don't. if your into side scrollers then this is for you. if not, like me, pass on this one.",0
an awful mmo which makes you a teddy. this teddy must defeat evil teddys. i don't like teddys.,0

the movies ruined what was awesome. forget the movies and check out this game.,1
"if you haven't heard of this game before there is something wrong with you, if you have why are you reading this instead of playing?",1
crazy hard but still amazing for a free game!,1
i think this is a great rpg game if your loaking to spend - hours of gameplay out of it you will glad that about and its a lot of fun and this the gameplay isnt a chore youll be happy and get rewarded for everything u do in the game from hp weps mana and dont judge the game on grachics judge it on gameplay.,1
"single player is great, plenty of updates for online but there is an issue with that. online is being ruined by an overwhelming amount of cheaters and rockstar has not confronted this issue as of yet. if rockstar fixes the unholy amount of people using trainers online i might play in a actual online game. for right now i wouldn't even pay . after all the waits they put us through and the lack of ingame security. dissapointing.",0
"a very good game - a mix between xcom and mass effect. don't listen to the haters saying its not a real xcom game as it's not turn based. you can play xcom now if you want turn based strategy, play the bureau if you want an rpg first person shooter game in the xcom universe.",1

"i just started playing, there is nothing wrong with this game, nothing is broken like people said. and the batmobile is awesome, it's one of the best things in this game and it's so easy to drive, either the people complaining suck at racing games or they patched something. anyways, so far so good, definitely worth playing.",1
"has great potential but you need to pay to actually have fun in game you can buy one of the different packs which different weapons and animal license, i would suggest the month membership its good for the price",0
pretty to look at but controls about as clunky as the ship looks like. limited enemy types and mechanics makes for a relatively boring game beyond the beautiful backgrounds.,0
"awesome story line, great graphics and lots of great witty humour!",1
do not buy it. they've gone corrupt.,0
best microwave-a-cat simulator out there. out of,1
"an excellent port of the classic guilty gear reload fight game, arcade, mom, mission mode, survival mode, training mode are all there. probably my favourite fighting game of all time, i only prefer the slash version to this because it's the most balanced. the muiltplayer is also good as long as you play with people above ping. there is a decent sized community, it's not huge but you can generally find a match if you're patient. much better than the ac r port, the netcode for that game at this moment is really bad reload continues to remain the best on-line ggxx at the moment.",1
"fun game, but is way too buggy to be considered complete.",0
"matchmaking is bad and inbalanced. you can find yourself in a match with only infantry troops agains tanks, planes, paratroopers. everything cost a lot and you dont much, so cleary designed as a p w. it cost to have a new character, to switch class, to buy new weapons, new upgrades, new vehicules. also, one of the worst points is the individual progression of each character. each character you buy dont share unlock. and if you previously buy a gun, you need to unlock it again and buy it again. add to it my previous argument, it become a pain. it may still be a beta, but it is one of the worst war game i played.",0
story game engine out of the game is totally worth a shot,1
"ok, it's clear that this game should not have been released so early. the game is riddled with bugs, the textures look like still images taken from the ship. the fact that you die if the water touches your chin is annoying there should be a swimming breathing mechanic, it would make the game so much more enjoyable. speaking of enjoyable, i didn't enjoy it. the only enjoyable moment was when i pretended i was the 'king of the world'. the ship was terribly laid out, with walls and doors that make no sense, so it made it frustrating to navigate. the fov was way to tight, couple that with the blurry textures and frame drops, well you might just throw up. so the tl dr is buy it if you want to pretend you're the 'king of the world' or just don't bother. i did make a video on it, if you care to give it a watch. i would appreciate it.",0
"review changed since release. when it first came out on steam, this game had less polish than the cossack hetmanate in the s. luckily, the developers have been releasing pacthes rushingly, so it might just become a great game, if they don't fall into the mistakes of other indie devs, that is, abandoning their project once it made enough money. regarding this, the game is free to play but borders on pay to win. it's still enjoyable if you don't buy stuff, but you'll be accordingly less weaker. the combat system is easy to learn and difficult to master. some might enjoy it, some not. give it a try and see if it pleases your palate.",1
"deep, compelling, immersive, philosophical, controversial, unfinished past its flaws, the sith lords is a great game",1
"if you play the original coh then stick to it as long as you can, coh was a huge disapointment, i'm so sad i wasted my money and such crap! all the fun long battles, changing terrain, and fun defensive abilities was quickly washed away by this sewage water of a game. don't buy this game!",0
"its lame, play starbound instead.",0
"this game gets flak it doesn't really deserve its a fun, if clunky shooter with some decent tense moments and gameplay variety in the form of three playable races. i suggest trying a diffrent race every time you find yourself getting tired of being a marine that makes the game quite a bit more enjoyable. the story is still pretty lame though. why can't the giant corporation do something practical and useful once in its whole damn existance? what kind of oil company could survive a massive oil leak every damn time it shipped something?",1
"my review is nothing more than a complaint. i didnt like the game, but it was my mistake buying it without understanding it is not multiplayer or that it would expect me to rp pre-made characters and switch between them. immersion gone, rp gone, fun non existent to me.",0
"dota is even far more better than his elder brother - dota with great game play and services, along with a big market for you to trade and earn benefit. however, since the day it became free to play, more and more players has been joining the community and spoil it. i lost some love with it, but still, dota is the best game with the best community i have ever played",1
fun but you need to buy a bunch of in-game purchases to have fun. would recommend it if you like to play casually.,1
bad game. nothing in this game was good and i had no fun at all while playing it. i expected more from it but it just wasn't there. dont buy this game or you will have to sit through hours of endless obnoxious pirate noises and terrible ai. blimey.,0
boring. completed once with diplomatic victory and no urge to play it through a second time. tech tree is obscure. battle cut scenes are repetitive. looks pretty though. nice game to fall asleep to.,0
"for the curious blood bowl is a turn-based tactical combat game, loosely based around american football, played with the fantasy races from warhammer, and with x-com style persistent characters. they gain skills, injuries, death. it's a gorgeous, rules-perfect nit-picks aside adaptation of the -year-old board game. it is goofy and stupid and fun while also providing quite a bit of strategic depth, if you have the stomach for dice-rolling and don't get too attached to your players . i have sunk entirely too many hours into this game.",1
"a clicker game that tries too hard to be innovative. lots of its design choices are questionable and the system has little explination. items have no explination except for a little vague hastag blurb, only one follower at a time, no idle system, and the fact that you need to save gold to buy keys to move forward in the game. overall the game feels very unrewarding and confusing and you're better off playing another free clicker on steam.",0
"eh, is really all i have to say about this game. i had a coupon and it was on sale at the same time so i sold a few trading cards to buy it. it's simplistic game play is fun for a while, but gets boring real fast. it's the kind of game you play while listening to a podcast. in the end all i'm going to say is that its not worth the price.",0
i don't ing recommed this game because it keeps deleting my families!,0
one of the best fps games ever.,1
"sucks do not try, waste of time. its nothing more than a poorly made counter strike rip off",0
"i want this game to be good, i was hoping it would be enough to take the place of dragon's prophet, but nexon had to do their thing. this game is plagued by horrifically slow main content updates fixes, and an over abundance of cash shop updates. we waited months for the level cap increase, meanwhile nexon was adding plushie familiar skins to the cash shop. we waited for fixes, slogging through fps drops, disconnects, latency spikes, meanwhile nexon gave us exclusive skins only available from loot boxes. we tried to get spammers removed, meanwhile bored afk familiar levellers were being banned. now there is no chat, there is no community, only the echoes of 'fast cheap gold at xxxxxx!'. if you think you can handle the solo mmo experience, and the knowledge that all public chat channels are used exclusively by spammers, then by all means give it a shot. however after all i've witnessed, i cannot recommend this game.",0
"perhaps evoland will be better but this game coasted off of kitchy video game references and very little substance. the game has one or two zones that are actually interesting zelda-like puzzles, but abruptly shifts gears and the game ends. good ideas and amusing gameplay. runs out of steam very quickly.",0
"very good game yes but pls release dlc rrrrrrrrrly fast pls, civ games always become better with dlc's. hmph",1
"i had a run about, mined some resources, collected some checkpoints and killed some drones. it's not performing great, i'm getting a steady fps but then suddenly it drops to fps for no apparent reason as i was just hanging around the ship at the time. often getting sound stuttering as well.. wouldn't recommend until they have done full compatibility and optimisation testing.",0
"i really enjoyed the game, kind of reminded me of wolf among us graphics with action and special mechanics that kind of reminded me of dead space telekinesis. i had a problem where i couldn't get through the vents at the brothel, but there is a vertical sync option in the settings that seemed to fixed my problem. i definitely enjoyed this game and would highly reccomend it, especially if it is on sale granted the story only lasted me six hours on a harder difficulty.",1
an absolutely amazing addicting game. so unfortunate that the multiplayer is broken with a horrendous customer service,1
dota is a nice game!,1
why didnt i win reelection in,0
"ok - i made it through about out of of this game and really wanted to like it. however i just got bored. its clearly a homage to the might and magic series similar ideas to world of xeen however you are better off just playing that series rather than this game. there is no animation, no voice, very few npcs - the world is pretty bland and lifeless. i understand that its the product of a small shop however it didn't capture my interest. you pretty much use the same battle tactics over and over while progressing through a pretty shallow story grinding away through levels. playing this actually inspired me to go back to an old might and magic game for another playthrough. the quality of those games still shines today. my advice - if you want a grid based crawler like this game, just go play the best might and magic games . gog has them running nicely on modern machines.",0
average game play lets down a beatifull game,0
"i loved the first portal, so once i heard that valve was releasing a second game i knew that i'd have to save up my pennies and grab the second iteratino eventually. and i can say that if you loved the first portal, then the second will be just as lovable. witty dialogue, humorous situations, mind bending puzzles, a decent length of a story mode, challenges to complete, and now a co-op mode that isn't dumbed down from the single-layer or worse, a dumbed down single-player experience that is only a training mode for online play. my only qualm with this game is that if you don't have a robust friends list then a few of the achievements are unattainable without going all over the place to fora to hopefully find someone that hasn't yet played but other than that no gripes here.",1
"awfull compared to the first game, only nice thing was the slightly better gameplay.",0
this would most proberly be a good game to play if it was a game and not a surver stopping you from playing any game with out dling all the maps for it plus a major down side in my case is it has no training or campain if it one or the other or even both i'd give it . stars but until then . stars,0
"so, i had this game for a while and now i bought it on steam. athough the menu flips, it's the best game i ever played from the starwars universe, except the mmo stwor",1
best fps story i have ever played.,1
"incredibly repetitive and boring. you can get more from the story by just reading the wiki. very depressing and tedious game. recommended if you like being railroaded and thinking your choices in the game matter they don't, the events turn out the same no matter what actions you take .",0
i recomend this game is nice,1
i think this game is very well thought out. the developers clearly took their time. they didn't charge . for their game. also can't wait to for the update with cavalry and stuff.. keep up the good work guys. i love the really realistic way people get shot by the way. it's awesome. i love it. gore to the max!!,1
why are you reading this!? you should've bought it already!,1
best f p gamwe fainelly a game that of zombie that actually free is't like dayz but is't a good game big map player alot server and pve pvp i love it and it good if love zombie game so you like this one,1
"the first hour and a half, i was really digging this game. it had everything the atmosphere, the sound direction, it was all perfect. then i kept playing.",0
i wish there will be a heist where you can rob panda express . worth everytime,1
"absolutely no improvement on the user interface, interface, game mechanics, performance or graphics from the previous sr and sr cw which i own both . forums are almost deserted and you could see the dustdevils in the modding section. during the game no relevant information is immediately available to player and even the most basic tasks require multiple clicks. stay away from it unless they reduce the price to something along the lines of -, for all of the supreme ruler games.",0
"meh. it's got some spooks and some scares, but the gameplay is just kinda 'walk around a look for stuff to scare you'. it was great for the time that it came out, but now there are better horror options.",0
great game considering you can get multiple classes and level them up while completing rewards,1
you play one level.. and it's all the same afterwards. there some levels that you must to exactly what the programer envision. solution.. no thank you.,0
"i haven't been this in love with a game since ravenshield. everything about it is so addicting and fun. there are a few small bugs that will need to be worked out but nothing to keep me from playing and absolutely recommending this game. also, i would like to thank ubisoft for not making a pay to win game like every other company out there! stop reading and buy!",1
one the best games i have ever played!!,1
"this game has yet to dissapoint if played on hard or above me. everything from the intense firefights, sneaky stealth play, and even the ending oh damn literally one of my favorite. please for your own sake get this game its an experience worth your time!",1
"the game in itself is actually rather good. the issue here is that the game is just full of bug's that keep you from fully enjoying the experience.. some even prevent you from playing the game at all. i just gave up half through the game because new bugs just kept appearing. i recommend you buy kotor , don't waste your money on this one unless you are willing to spend time modding patching the game to a playable state.",0
love this game. cried when win wouldn't run it. new steam version runs great though! speach is silver but violence is golden!,1
"nice and graphical as always. love the sneaky parts of the game. sadly it's way to little with the cloak and dagger stuff and to much of the run-n-gun part since you can do that all through the game. still a good sniper game, in fact, one of the better ones at the moment.",1
the best game for cool mods ! i like it ! if you add vodka mod you are the best !,1
"evolve is a lovely game! there is nothing like being 'the monster' you against others! the graphics are great, along with smooth gameplay! overall if you love a shooter, sci-fi and having fun in a online game, this is for you!",1
"haven't been able to play this game. on startup i get the server screen, my game freezes for about seconds - minute. when i join a game, i'm inable to disconnect or leave, or even play in a group.. don't buy this game, not even on sale. you rather wanna buy weapons for cs go instead",1
"great game one of my favorite indie games of all time. its the perfect example of what a rougelike should be every time i play a new game its diffrent from the previous with new challanged, weapons, crew, ect.",1
"i liked terrarria. this seems derivative with larger sprites. getting larger sprites may have been enough to sell a sequel from nes to snes, but the larger sprites don't really work. terrarria could have had larger sprites.",0
to be honest i was excited to see that this game was finaly makeing a spot for the pc but seeing how it has alot of graphical issues for some but for others it runs fine idk what to think about the pc port but really just a chance that it will work or break down fast,0
"intro as a longtime rts fan returning to computer gaming after a five-year hiatus, this hits all the right notes. pros campaign is short and enjoyable great casual multiplayer distinct factions with hordes minimal micromanagement economy straightforward with interesting options great interface short matches very well designed low system reqs cons not flavourful- sides are rather generic but really, so is classic gdi renegade campaign can drag too many missions best with -bit hordes game and guardians campaign dlc for a total of summary for a casual rts experience, this is a great one. if you want a fun, arcade-y rts game that's more about having fun than memorizing current metas, this is the game for you. clearly made by rts veterans with lessons learned from two decades of rts games. out of all the games i've played, this ranks up with dawn of war dark crusade as my favorite rts games of all time. rts background sc all sp, dabbled in pvp , aoe series, wc , supreme commander, sotse,dow, coh, sc bw, ta",1
this game was supposed to be a first perso assassin's creed from what i was told. god it's awful. the worst thing about this game was the user interface. wielding both a gun and sword at the same time that took up half the screen was hideous. the ugly health and magic bar were an interesting idea but became an annoyance in the end. i could only stand this game for . hours before i got sick of it telling me where to go as opposed to letting me explore.,0
"this game is so laggy it's just ridiculous.you can't do anything because of the massive lag, and also lots and lots of bugs , loading screen freezes, mid-game freezes, it's pathetic.the game has great potential but it's ruined by the lag and bugs.",0
i definitely love the feel of the game ! out of,1
i hate this game so much out of,0
"played the saints row games for a very long time and each game always brings a little something extra to the table. sr has..questionable..interactions with fellow friends in the game. many may not like it but i think the developers had a good kick out of iuncluding it in the game. if you don't know what i mean you will after playing thios game for a few hours. unfortunatily no matter how awesome saints row vi is i can't get behind the aliens. specifically driving down a section of road just chillen to hack a station and they will just pop up out of nowhere when you haven't even raised a enemy alarm. just annoys alot cause you can barely get a good pedestrain bumper combo before the alein swarm wrecks everything. awesome game with new powers, weapons that run on energy instead of bullets so that's a huge saving in ammo. the ability to run super-fast and smash vechiles out of the way is really awesome if you need a quick getaway.",1
"gud game while it lasted, kind of live up to its hype. although certainly it lacks the charm of the earlier bioshock series. and how the heck do you guys kill the big guy with a pistol and without getting hit ?",1
this is the worst game ever i never recommand it and its glitchy as well,0
"i can only recommend banished. it is exactly what i want from a city building simulation. no superficial enemies, no fantasy elements. just the challenge of building and maintaining a working infrastructure. the gameplay is strangely soothing while stressing you out at the same time without throwing obvious stress situations at you. there are no events except for catastrophes that try shaping your game leaving only the ultimate goal, survival. you build what you want and soon enough you will have created your own problems to take care of. if hits the fan there is no safety net. no one to hold your hand as you watch the decent of your town. nothing to fall back on except your own creativity in problem solving or crushing defeat. i see myself sinking many more hours into this before getting tired of it and will certainly need that time to polish my building strategies.",1
"surprisingly addicting, a great game if you like the whole top down space shooter thing.",1
"total ripoff, spend your money elsewhere because when using steam you will get locked out of it and the website is broken so you can't get a password reset or anything. just look at other games.",0
"im not rating the game, just uplay",0
"i never played the first one, but the concept of this game was enoughf or me to give it a try. i can offer you nothing more in the way of a review then tell you i only get to about minutes of play a session before the game crashes. its pretty fun that every minutes, but never enough to really get involved in the game.",0
"this game is simply just horrifying, not to the extreme, but good enough. this should have more attention to it and become a better game throughout the years.",1
get ready to sleep with your lights on a true horror game,1
second helpings of an already fantastic game. puzzles are now more multifaceted and a few set pieces are featured in each room. just gotta wait for the room three.,1
"i'm a huge, huge fane of the original x-com. i was really looking foward to this game and hoped an indie company could restore the glorius gameplay that was x-com -- but they fall short. they really try to be true to the source material, but nothing quite meshes. graphics and animations are meh and the a.i. still makes those magical shots from yards away, around the tree, under the car, through the two house windows -- killing your soldier instantly. on the other end of the spectrum, you will miss the alien standing next to you, with a plasma shot gun and cth -- and if you are lucky enough to hit it, it will take a whopping damage, while the other of your soldiers will panic, drop their gun, and run right up to the enemies for a merciful quick killing. it's very frustrating, to say the least. so close, but so far.",0
not nearly as fun or adorable as i expected. probably should have realized it was a game for young kids. heh.,0
"amazingly cool fps focused on puzzles which follows an interesting and touching linear story. expect around - hours for a single playthrough if you are taking your time, and there are some extra challenges as well. i remember when this game was new there was an almost instant custom mapping scene with different people on online communities making their own challenge maps and you were able to download those, and i spent a great deal of time playing them all definitely recommend this and portal as well, both are must play games!",1
"awesome game, real challanges and nice graphics",1
"this would be a good game , but there are too many buggs . i know, it's an old game . but then again, it doesn't play nice. i regret that i don't like the game because of all the bugs. railroad tycoon and are a lot of better. buy that guys.",0
the workshop literally makes the game better. not to mention it has tons of replay value. there's just something about mowing down hordes of zombies that just brings a tear to your eye.. u out of,1
at least they are still steadily working on this and patching it. sadly it is still not there. hopefully it will be playable for me soon.,0
this game was so uncomplete that the ingame text boasted features the game did not have. it was like watching napolean dynamite where you spend all this time watching it only to realize that that was truly all there was to it.,0
the games are very well made every cards are cool but the st problem is if you dont have money in this game you cant win because other addicted player have premium pay to win cards your free to play cards cant win against premium. the nd problem is you cant play long because everytime you play your energy exhaust when you fight you have to wait every to minutes to play against different players or ai. the rd problem is when you buy dlc you dont get it because of the bug you have to send a ticket to get your dlc i only recommend this for rich player who spend thousand of dollars.,0
this of a game runs at ing frame per every ing second. laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg,0
"a fantastic, thrilling adventure that's good for a short play session that is well worth the money. it's a thrilling adventure, that makes you feel a true sense of being alone. but at the same time, a sense of being right next to someone else, working together. a great title that needs another adventure soon in its books. i would love a prequel to this, perhaps covering the previous year before this games setting. make it happen campo santo!",1
poor game alot of lag questes marks are not on the map marken propely so this game i would give it a out of very bad i dont think you should play this l,0
"rubbish. 'nuff said. now i can't even get a damn refund because i didn't know there was a hour limit, if you play for more than hours, valve basically has a 'screw you' policy on getting a refund. hello games is being investigated by the advertising standards authority for false advertising, that should tell you all you need to know. so now i'm stuck with a game i payed usd aud for, and will never play again because of valve's poor refund policy. -company being investigated for false advertising, still can't get refunded-. out of game sucks worse than e.t. the extra terrestrial. from , which ended up in a hastily dug grave in mexico somewhere.",0
"i remember when this game came out, it was optimized awfully, now i read the reviews and see the playbase is dead, there's your reason why no-one played this game. optimized poorly on release. not sure now.",0
"micro machines but not as good, player is awful.",0
i've played hours and so far i've only gotten seconds in. imagine you're in a maze where the walls move in to you and change constantly and if you touch the wall you die. only the maze is different every time. and the maze rotates and bounces. and if you die you start over from the beginning.,1
"this game is perfect. all mk characters, great gameplay, all of the best features from the previous mk games and a nice story mode make this game a fantastic production.",1
"ok graphics, good game mechanics and it's fun to play. however the voice acting is probably the worst i have ever heard in a game ever - it's like it was scripted and acted by someone with the emotional depth of a year old. your character is frankly quite creepy too since he often has a good laugh after killing animals. i would have said that this was an ok buy if you get it for a dollar or two as i did but now having got half way through chapter one the game has started crashing frequently shortly after i summon a creature this is on a relatively recent mac bookpro . so at this point i'd not recommend it to anyone with a mac at any price - no clue whether it is more stable on windows.",0
i downloaded it and it keeps crashing help,1
"i say a lot of games are 'the best' on my recommendations. well. this game isn't the best at a few things. my gripes are game length at about five hours for the main story, the ammo mechanics you need to pickup the same weapon on the ground to reload, or execute someone , and some of the cover physics got stuck occasionally, sometimes you vaulted over an obstacle instead of ran to cover . the story makes this game awesome. the story makes this 'the best' third person or first person shooter for folks who actually like a bit of plot and background to their games. it is a fun journey, feeling a lot like a modern apocalypse now. the twists and turns along the way are interesting and feel fresh in the setting that you find yourself in. major fanboy bonus points for bruce boxleitner being one of the main characters in the game. he's got the perfect voice for the role he plays.",1
unbalanced and plain just not fun.,0
"bad game mechanics for such am overhyped game. frame rates are not what they should be, the engine could be better. buy the old cod-games instead.",0
i remember when this game was fun. good game. unfortunantly economic problems do arise and this is what happens.,0
"this game is terrible, the missions are really boring and long, they want you to fly one jet and finish the mission for a whole division! and the enemies you destoried in each mission are propably more than the entire military forces of a small country like pakistan! and your ai allies are all dumb and useless, all their job is endless request for your assists, they can not even handle one lonely enemy tank or fighter you ommit to clear, and if they die, your mission is failed. and your enemy's fighter is sooo good that even it's hit by a missle, it can still be operated normally unless you finally destory it! there are still many annoying or dumb things in this game i dont bother to mention, generally speaking, this game sucks!",0
get it! awesome game for all your buddies p,1
"ing horrible. most of the time it doesn't start, the rest it laggs to crap",0
"in my first hour of playing this game, i've struggled to ignore the very pay to win feeling this game provides. you have to pay for a couple of more bag slots, with a heavily advertised premium account which you need to buy when you die, it costs real money to revive at the same spot you died, and you don't even benefit of a few daily revives you die alot . secondly, all the npc's send you on trips across maps, and give you nearly impossible tasks, i am talking about secondary quests, that request you to kill certain boss monsters, which you cannot face alone. this review is my first impression of the game, and if it accounts for anything, the better. tl dr pay to win boring slow nothing special about it",0
"this is a great rail shooter. amazing visuals, and fast, fluid gameplay ok, it kind of feels like cheating to use a mouse in this game.. . and the story? talk about completely ridiculous, and absolutely hilarious. in fact, you should play this game just for the story. only problem i have with it is when it ended, i was seriously left thinking really? that's it? it doesn't wrap up its story very well, and is practically begging for a sequel, or dlc, or something that will wrap up the loose ends.",1
"do you like left dead ? do you wish the zombies were instead policemen with assault rifles? then you've found the right game! just be sure to land in a lobby with experienced players, otherwise things will go a bit south rather quickly, regardless of the difficulty you're in. i enjoyed playing payday . the mechanics aren't as sharp as counterstrike but it gets the job done regardless. the music that kicks in when 'it' hits the fan makes my ears bleed a bit, but it's easy to turn off to allow for total concentration, which you will need. the graphics are adequate and hold up well enough, though there are a lot of blurry textures. if you do notice the textures though, that means that you stopped to smell the roses, which means that the cops broke in through the other window, your teammates are down, it's all your fault, and now you've been kicked. way to go, you. for even more details, check out my concise video review below",1
like skyrim but without anything good.,0
"i hate point and click adventure games. . . i find them to be obtuse and difficult for no real reason. on the other hand, i had to play this one. it looks incredible, the vibe is so amazing.. i still boot it up just get to back into the feeling that this game sets. game play is as expected for a point and click i suppose .. click on a lot of things, combine them in ways that make no sense. the story is excellent, the humor is witty.. this game gets a out of for me just because of the atmosphere alone. . . oh and dont forget the incredible gritty sound track.",1
all of a sudden this game no longer works .. not sure what happened but i get a cutscene error and a language error and it auto closes .. not very happy about it either,0
"i couldn't quite put my chivalry review into a few sentences, so here comes a haiku i swing my longsword teammate hit, voted and kicked use mouse wheel next time",1
"recent changes to this game have ruined it. special abilities now require stamina to be stored up to use. if i wanted to wait rounds to do my special ability i would never have chosen it. anyway, the game is a lot harder and super annoying now to me so i would not suggest it to others.",0
"i love mad max. i love devery movie except thunderdome.. . i love the idea, the franchise, mel gibson, etc, etc. but this game is just so empty.. and boring. the combat is a crappier version of the batman gamess. car combat is pretty fun but the game just feels too empty. the storyline is stupidly bland and there isn't enough crazy like in the old mad maxes. you don't feel threatened at all by riders or combatants. this game is easy mode. also purchasing the upgrades for all your fortresses is stupidly tedious and annoying. searching for mines for hours.",0
"such neat ideas, but it controls terribly for mouse keyboard and just decently for a gamepad. the controls are clearly made for a flight-stick. the tutorial is not voiced and is not comprehensive or part of a campaign story to introduce the game world to you, and combat is tiresome instead of exciting. the starting vehicle, at least, turns so slowly that dog-fighting in it is ridiculous. the other problem i have is that it delights in minutia that other games automate for you like parking at a station or scanning a system. i'm sure there is an audience that enjoys this game, but i'm looking for a successor to games like privateer - not a tarted up x . maybe star citizen won't crawl so far up hardcore flight-sim fans bottoms that it is unapproachable to the rest of us or maybe this will become more approachable and less of a risk to take a gamble on with a lower price in the future. but for now, i'm definitely not keeping it.",0
"great game, has a few issues, but are easily fixed!",1
"it's pretty clever with its humor, but honestly it gets pretty boring after a few minutes of gameplay. i'm hoping i didn't try for too long to find any fun in this game before i ran out of time to refund..",0
"the game is broken, the servers cannot connect and it is an endless disconnecting, if you are trying to play singleplayer you will still be disconnected from the game because its an always online game. so you can be halfway through a mission and be disconnected and loose all your progress, and none of it would be saved. a majority of my 'play time' is idle time, waiting to log back into god damn singleplayer the producers and developers will ignore everyone, and steam will not refund, do not buy the game on pc",0
this is a great game for the price but any more and i'd say make it a flash,1
this is a really good fun game. i have shown it to two friends of mine and they both thoroughly enjoyed it as well.,1
"i like calamity trigger and blazblue as a whole. i have it for ps , so i was hyped for it getting a pc port. but this port is garbage. not worth it tbh.",0
this game is do not buy it it sucks vagazle for money,0
"played this alot with friends on ps this game has some nice characters, awesome soundtrack and very flashy combos only my friends can do that i can't. even though i feel about under-average on this game, it's totally fun to spar with others, finding different not messy tactics to get closer to winning. the sale price i got for it was awesome btw! so expensive compared to this steam version lt",1

"iron from ice!! out of - wood forrest again p this game is awesome. what would you expect when you cross tell tale with game of thrones. this game has the most complicated story out of all the tt games. you switch between more characters than other tt games. and there's more guilt and anxiety than all tt and got combined. the only thing lacking from my playthrough was the lack of nudity, which is a staple of got. i do not know if others have encountered naked men or women but i doubt it. if you like both tt and got and feeling like you just killed a small animal, then this is the game for you.",1

"pros good muliplayer - you can do any campaign mission with your friends open world - there's a lot to do in the game besides just playing through the story story - although it is not a super rich story, it is entertaining customizable - you can customize car color, car body parts, car wheels, clothes and colors, gangs, etc cons unrealistic physics - the game's physics are incredibly unrealistic, your guy flips and bounces from cars and explosions. story - you cannot replay the story after you beat the game, you have to start over on a new save dlc - there's lots of dlc available, but its around - for a few new clothes or a new car or two notes the game as a whole seems like kind of a joke. if you're looking for a serious game, this may not be for you. if you're looking to just mess around and have fun by yourself or with friends, you'll probably enjoy saints row the third a lot",1

"i guess its 'ok'. the graphics are very basic, and feel stylized and makeshift. esp if you know saubnautica . weird is that you sink to the ground and have 'leaps', instead of swimming, so the game feels more like low gravity than underwater.. you feel could easily reskin in for, say the moon. still, an ok game for - hours. then you have the adventuring mode though, and the 'one life' mode is the same.",0
a very good game much better than the second one in my opinion,1
"what makes this game so great is the numerous ways you can go about getting the job done, from stealthy to guns blazing and anywhere inbetween. the replay value is high and with the ability to create contracts for others to play or play contracts created by others the fun is endless. great game i give it out of just bcoz no game is perfect",1

"honestly an amazing game. great story, great character design, fun multiplayer. with better marketing and not launching at the same time as overwatch it could be a lot more successful. for people wondering whether to get this or overwatch, know that battleborn is nothing like overwatch. it's more like a cross between monday night combat and borderlands. aside from the low player base, the only real issue i have with it is screen clutter. the animations are pretty, but they're all over the place. hard to tell what's going on at first until you start to get the hang of it. i recommend buying it because please we need more people in matchmaking!! although if that sounds like a dealbreaker, you can still play a full singleplayer campaign",1
"this game is a masterpiece. forget about the turnbase x-com, except for the story, its not at all the same type of game. but its my type of game. like reading a good book. i always had nightmares happening in the , don't ask me why because i was born in . but the feel of the game recreate perfectly the old sci-fi movies of that time, the music, the design , the colors, everything. like in my damn nightmares. every minutes when i was playing i told myself what a great game it is. i dont know if they will release another game of this type, its not really opened for a sequel. but forget the negative comment of the sad people because its not turn based, thats a really great game.",1
it was re-released for free and i want a refund,0
it a pretty good rpg to play with friends and to pass the time too.,1
this is a very very nice game good.,1
this game is an incredible mmorpg. its very smooth compared to some of the mmorpgs i have played and the character creation is amazing. the character creation doesn't just end when you start playing either it continues on throughout the game as you can choose what you wear. say you have one item for example gods boob plate and it looked badass as hell. then you go another item called satans boobplate which had much greater stats but horrible looks. you can equip satans boobplate but still have the look of gods boobplate. you can also change the colour of the armour as much as you like without paying for dyes or paying real money. it isnt really a pay to win game more of a pay to get better asthetics which is what an mmorpg should be. the only downside i have with the game is how big the game is. like holy hell its something like gb. to be honest it is one of the best mmos i have ever played and its worth the wait of downloading. i rate from personal experiences . out of,1
"at the beginning it tries to be a simulation, no radar, no map, no indication of killing an enemy, and then somehow, you magically respawn. sorry i just don't know where you are going with this - shooter or simulation? .. it does not even feel realistic. and then you respawn, magically. stupid fps don't buy it.",0

"this is personally my favorite zombie survival game. this new iteration of left dead gives a lot more to the world than the first game, not saying any of them is bad because both are great, the second game just adds more to the world. in the first game all of the original campaigns are dark and horror. the new game has both light and more pleasant campaigns, but it also tops the dark and horror campaigns in the first game. i must say 'hard rain' is really scary, it starts out all nice and light, but ends in stormy weather, thunder and lighnings and water flooding.",1

"i do not recommend this game, the game is highly unbalanced and there is no changes in sight that i can tell will happen to make the game fair. as for my skill i must admit that i am relatively new and even there is an even more larger issue with match making. if you are level you should play with someone at least within levels of yourself not level 's.. i loved coh but coh has dropped the ball on this one. i don't recommend this game.",0

"honestly, the 'beautification' ruined the game for me. i loved this game as a kid, and what i wanted to come back to was improved skins on what i had as a kid. instead i was greeted with really creepy skins that were rather buggy. also the resolutions and such would occasionally crash my drivers. so no. i will play the original. thanks for trying i guess though out of",0

"i found it weird at first because the game has no script or dialogues. just pictures of what had happened. you have to interpret the visuals yourself. but, i like the idea that you're free to interpret it however you want. kinda drives your inner conspiracy theorist. aside from being a standard top-down game, the challenges from bosses to even the ordinary mobs gave me something to look forward to surpassing. hell, i died more than times on that bird boss and the mobs before him. all in all it's a out of for me. looking forward to finishing up this game.",1

"edited the game is fun and not for everyone. it's very hardcore. it's what you'd go to after you finish skyrim, after you ran out of npc's to kill only everyone's doing it still . f p isn't bad. no pay to win problems i can see. imagine dayz elder scrolls of warcraft. that's this. like damn, hardcore much? only way to possibly get out of town is to join a guild. friendly guilds weren't on the main continent when i played, so the forums are kinda mandatory if want to play.. forces you to be social kinda. unless you're really.. good?",0

"so this is it. super hot. could have been a super hot game. sadly i cannot recommend the game in its current state due to awful lags i got a nvidia gtx and intel core i gb ram pc, all drivers are up-to-date and the reeeally bad pricing. seriously. you can't just ask for a price that high for a game that doesn't have to offer much. or are you guys planning an update that doubles the content? well, i really enjoy myself while playing but it would be much better if the lags weren't there, this needs to be fixed. and also the developers should really think about lowering the pricetag dollars would be fitting for a game content like this .",0
"please do not purchase this game, there's so many more survival games that outshine this. this game is riddled with hackers, and devs to little to nothing to take care of this. it's been out for far too long for this to be the case. not to mention on top of that has microtransactions and extreme private server costs. in many cases as well, your account will be banned without reason, sometimes after initially purchasing the game.",0

"the game is well designed and a good alternative to diablo . there's a major problem with its lag - point and click where you want your avatar to go and frequently they will wait and then go. enemies will freeze and then go. click on an enemy to fight and the click may register as where you wanted your avatar to go. this comes from the always on connection to the makers' servers and i don't see a work-around. my system, ti, k gently oc'd, measured up and download connection. while it is free to play and does not seem to offer 'pay to win,' i unfortunately cannot recommend it.",0

"i found ebf to be a light and adorable old-timey style rpg with a good sense of humor. gameplay should be familiar to anyone with jrpg experience, and many of the jokes refer to classic titles. plenty of 'quests' on which you can go, and lots of achievements to unlock. i enjoyed the soundtrack very much. found the enemy-strengthening curve to be not what i expected and at first a bit annoying, but in retrospect i thought it was appropriate and provided a good challenge. only possible downsides in my opinion are length of play and replayability. i prefer to be casual with my gaming these days, and this provided a weeked of cute, nostalgic fun. you can pick it up and put it down at your own pace since you can save anywhere. if you want something a little longer and more involved this may not be your favorite. not sure if it will have much replay value, but completely worth a free download.",1
"the game was so nice and perfect like - years ago. then the owner of the game decided to accept some cheats in their client and started to sell game money game item with real money. everything changed at that time and many old players has left the game as i did the same. now it is coming with steam and we want to trust steam that you will protect the game from cheats. whatever happens, i cannot recommend this game right now.",0
"this game has too many faults to ever be good. physics are highly inconsistent, npc ai is inconsistent. the ai always take corners wide and which inevitably leads to collisions. no matter how you try you always come out as the loser in any collision which means passing is a huge chore. passing is mandatory since you always start close to last place so you can't just stay out front. to top it off in touge matches collision equals disqualification, but if you are in the lead and the npc hits you you get disqualified not your opponent how does that make sense? one last quip that should scare all race fans away is that the npc cars occasionally get 'power ups' i've been in an identical car to the npc and watched them blow by me on a straightaway like they have nitrous.. how do you win when that happens? simple you can't. do not buy this game.",0

"when i wrote my review for fallout , i feel i was too jaded. i still stand by my arguments as people should be more critical of bethesda, yet i think modern standards have made them appear less impressive with time. i wanted to revisit the tes games as i feel their exploration, rpg, and lore elements are what bethesda excels in this series. oblivion seemed the most obvious first choice as it paved the way of a wrpg standard. morrowind's dice-roll system and other design decisions make it too archaic. i'm not saying it's bad it's simply a different experience. what i did not expect to come away with was my utter contempt for bethesda by their lack of quality control with their past games. it is simply inexcusable to be ignored as, 'oh, it's bethesda what did you expect?' damned if you mod and damned if you don't",0

"take on helicopters seemed to me not to be a 'new' game as they say on the bohemia interactive website but a glorified dlc for arma , liked the in cockpit toggles, but come on bohemia you could have made it cheaper for those that have arma already and launched it as a dlc.",0
"sadly there is not much to say, apart from.. crash crash crash crash crash walk a few steps, crash. climb up a ladder, crash. the game options do not even seem to save change volume, save and quit. relaunch game and volume is back to original setting . doesn't fill me with confidence. also, the game doesn't seem to work in windowed mode at all shoves it in the bottom half of the screen and is unmovable . not sure why this game is still on steam if the developers have no intention of updating it so it works on more modern pcs or even multi monitor setups. refund requested. sgt bash",0
the update is garbage! what the hell rockstar? all my saves are gone and my mods are all broken! you rockstar!,0
"this game's story is okay. however it is much too short to really develop the characters. i get that this is based off of a true story, but i feel that this story would have made a better fit for a short animation or movie of some sort. the actual 'game' part is very minimal and takes a back seat to the continuous dialogue and messages that the main character gets. you don't even have to play anything as the other character will kill everything for you and neither of you can die. the art was okay, and seeing glimpses into this person's life was interesting, albeit a little creepy.",0
this game is good don't get me wrong but you must not download it through steam. the steam version of the game is outdated and refuses to run. the files on steam havent been updated for the recent files therefore the only way to play it is to download the game directly from the installer found on the planetside website,0
"this game is really fun, despite low level graphics and has lots of potential.",1
this game is why hitler killed the jews,0
"i played this for a while and i honestly have to say i had fun with this while i could, then i started getting vote kicked on every public onslaught or pvp server i went on. knowing that i don't make many friends on steam or anywhere else i just gave up on it. was a great game but the community now compared to what it was is awful.",0
"more parts are on their way, but in the current state, it's not worth the full ten dollars. i completed it without tutorials in less than three hours, and i lack the common sense to solve most puzzles without heavy pondering. here's an actual review for you in this game, you are a.r.i.d., an ai helping an unconcious piot to safety by controlling his mechanical suit. all this game really boils down to is a point-and-click adventure game with some short combat sequences, from a side-scrolling perspective. the atmosphere is well-made, but i feel a majority of the puzzles are a bit too open-ended for one, you have to jump underneath a ten-foot-wide elevator where the only control panel for it is on the elevator itself . again, it's not worth it in its current state. i may change my review when more content is added. there is a twilight zone-caliber ending, though.",0
"spend a little bit of time on this game. and i gotta say i kinda love it. game some what broken but you gotta do what's right according to the game not to ur senses if you are cheap af, don't buy this game cus it will burn ur wallet also gambling in this game is a thing if you into that sort of things",1
"first, let me say that i understand all of the disappointment that has been expressed concerning this game. the thing i dislike the most about this game is that it is not finished. there are little things, like not having much control over landing the ship, or flying in general for that matter. then the big things, like no multiplayer at all. but through all of that, i cannot bring myself to totally hate no man's sky because when i play it i get the feeling of the thrill of exploration. sometimes the sounds, music, and soul crushing loneliness of this game scares the crap out of me! i hope hello games will keep working on it and fulfill the promise of this game. it's something i think everyone should try out, but not at full price. this game needs to be at . usd, and the promo videos need to be updated on the store page to reflect the game as currently available.",0
it's fun and free what more do you want?,1
"well, this game literally isn't working for me. it was working fine days ago. and now when i click play, it literally wont open. i tried re-installing it but that didn't fix the problem. idk what is happening. i have windows btw.",0
"this is not a flatout game. it may have the name, but it is made by a different studio, and feels absolutely terrible. with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, i'd heartily suggest you skip this one and go straight for flatout ultimate carnage instead. now that's a great racing game!",0
one of the worst action rpgs i have ever played,0
"i'm blown away -------------------------------- this, by far, to me is one of the best games in terms of aesthetics and storyline. to me it was so compelling to not know what's going on but when you figure it out it just confuses you in a way that just makes it seem so good. some of the enemies were in terms of how to get past them but literally the or that there are don't really ruin the gameplay. the storyline is truly unique! you start out livivng a normal life then it turns into a show as you inhabit another body and go on to finish what wasn't completed. being umanities last hope kinda made me feel like a hero or something. the game has such a great atmosphere too. imagine bioshock making babies with alien isolation and amnesia in a very rough and bloody sex marathon that lasted several hours and out came this. this game, to me, is an absolutely great game and i recommend it to the fullest extent if you're into the whole defenseless horror hide and seek ype stuff. out of",1
"probalby the best friendzone simulator ever made. the question is, can we even get out of this zone? whatever..emily is away.",1

very entertaining. i use linux and a lot of these commands are in linux. i am actaually glad hacking is not this easy in the real world.,1
crashers everytime i first start it up,0
"just started, but the game looks very promising. graphics are beautiful, story seems catchy and the gameplay is very creative. strongly recommend it to people that like story driven games.",1
"i don't understand what the complaint is here. the game was released in a decent, fun state and the new dlc adds a new race, mini campaign and the same patch adds additional free content. this is precisely the kind of thing dlc is supposed to be for, and it's pretty damn good as far as dlc goes.",1
"entertaining for a few play sessions, but not enough truly unique content to justify the pricetag. 'infinite' play area via procedural generation doesn't cut it without interesting gameplay. never going to pre-order anything again, so dissapointed. i also feel mislead by the developers marketing - no multiplayer came as a shock. there is so much about the gameplay that is inexplicably missing or simply bad. lack of planet maps, for one. or they buried the capability somewhere i couldn't find it. the fuel for pulse drive being everywhere in the universe. if they didn't want us to get stranded, then remove the fuel requirement. don't litter space with tons of the mineral everywhere. cluttered and boring. what i did like hunting down alien words and slowly becoming better at understanding them. that was fun, roaming around looking for ruins and artifacts. but it's not enough to keep me playing. at this point it doesn't matter, as it seems pretty obvious after hours of playtime there is all to do beyond what i've already done. oh well, can't get a blockbuster title every time we pay a blockbuster price i guess..",0
"the ai is clueless. when attacking a city without a wall as a cavalary heavy minor it blobs all it troops in one street, completely ignores bypasses to get into the back of the defenders and doesn't even try to attack the completely undefended and reachable archers which thanks to lots of arrows slowly decimate the cavlary and that was ai against ai, while i was watching from afar due to being draw into the combat by an overeager ally . oh my god! does creative assembly still have programmers left or are they all skin designers?",0
this is a very addictive game and it as an amazing gameplay!!,1
"loading time and hackers makes me want to leave this game .. the main game to me is not appealing, the story and the characters are not something i can get fond to, and all the changes comparing this to gtaiv makes me wonder why this game y so bad in comparision the online is the only thing i like about this one but it takes near hour to load and once you are in, you only get to play with hakers if you dont have any friends playing, fi you want to play a single player game i recomend more to play gta iv or even san andreas if you want some onlie experience try to get online with some friends otherwise atay away from this ..",0
"so, here's the thing. i have cortex command. i play it a fair amount. it's got some fun elements. so, why the negative review? this game never really finished development. the game was very very cool as a concept when it was first released, but the ui is as bad as it has always been, there are frequent bugs, winning is pretty formulaic v. ai, and there are severe problems with multi. the underlying concepts? fun. the implementation? still incomplete. felt like something that got rushed to release with some minor new releases once the creator got bored.",0
best clicker game i ever played,1
"honestly, everquest is an amazing mmo.. but heres the problem, it has suddenly become beyond horribly optimized. this game is nearly as old as wow and yet my laptop cannot run everquest over fps. when i play wow i can run it at almost max fps. unless this game is optimized i donot reccommend installing everquest until then.",0
my computer knew better than me. it crashed over and over on startup. my computer was smarter than me.,0
"its style is sure unique, but it did not prevent me from getting some fun from it. even though i still do not understand why did they need to implement those seduction missions and i also believe the story could be better and characters deeper. but final fight reminded me of final fight in dmc , which is good. i'll give it.. out of",1
"really fun game. i didn't have any idea what i was doing at first and loved it, then once i actually figured out how to play, i loved it even more. you have classes in this game gunner, pilot, and engineer. the gunner gets more ammo types than any of the other classes, the engineer gets more repair and buff tools, and the pilot gets the most piloting skills abilities they can activate while flying that have special effects, such as buffing the ship but damaging it or creating a giant smoke cloud . there are a fair variety of weapons for your ship like gattling guns, shotguns, sniping guns, medium-range flak cannons, and flamethrowers. each has its advantages and disadvantages. finding the right combo of gun and ammo type can be devastating to enemies. all in all this game is pretty awesome, though it can be a bit unstable and crash sometimes for me at least .",1
i think this game coundt get better than on when i have it on ds but then it gose on steam and wow!!,1
i bought it times. why the hell did i do that,1
"fun, gore, filled with dark humor, crazy settings and weapons. always wanted to love cats, never could. this game gave me a reason to love them. sadistic, yet so funny that i sometimes felt a little bad loving it so much. it's a goold old fashioned shooter, the way duke nukem was for my generation, yet more twisted than the games it takes inspiration from. if you're not afraid of blood, crude and dark humor, you must play this game. it's awesome for what it is and, hey, gary coleman is in there.",1
greight game i reight eight out of eight meight,1
great game in the spirit of the original borderlands series.. but it's taking too long for telltale to release the next episode.,1
"a fun zombie game, comes with three games. lots of good weapons and always keeps your interest. you can complete the original game mode in less than an hour. short but sweet. i got it for and was extremely impressed. even the original price is a great deal.",1
"a rather short game, however the amount of detail in it is pleasing. at this point, from what i've played through so far, it's not really worth . i do love it though as it came free with fx-, however knowing what it is, wouldn't exactly pay full price. game itself has a lot of possible twists and things to uncover, which later help out or link with late-game missions. dialogue choices actaully makes massive difference in how you end or proceed with mission. replay value is pretty big but initially for lethal and non-lethal playthrough, that's if we're talking major difference between replays. there are a few missions where you have to make your choice meaning you can initially stick with your playstyle and still get different experience. recommended, just wait for sale.",1
great game. amazing mechanics. in-depth heists and several methods for each heist. out of almost perfect. gouged to with a ton of dlc and brand new microtransactions!,0
"decent game. i really enjoy it, but don't be fooled by the free to play. it is definately a free to play, but to get any sort of decent upgrades you have to pay for it. if you're looking for a third person shooter to play with your friends for a while this might be it.",1
"ugliest game ever, overly complicated for nothing, grindy, no gameplay, don't get it.",0
"at first glance this looks like a great game maker. but it's really a waste of money as of now, let me explain. do you know how the far cry lever editor you can script and build mountains. in gameguru you really have less things to do. this is a level editor. if you make games with this and then compare them, you would see how they are almost exactly alike. you will see buildings and models repeat over and over again. even if the games are different genres the game machcanics will just have a slight tweak. if the person you show this to doesnt know about gameguru, they would think dempending on how good the game is they would think it's quite ok. you are also stuck with basic models and store bought models. no customisation at all. on top of the price gameguru, you may have seen that i said ''store bought models''. that's because you can buy models, some times even in a pack, for some almost more than gameguru its self! so if you look into making a actual game and not just a level, don't buy this.",0
"this game kept me entertained every hour that i played it. it is definitely worth playing. almost every action i did felt like it had impact, because the world of this game felt real, in its own crazy exaggerated way. the world is thoughtfully crafted and amazing to look at and drive through the storms alone are fantastic . the characters are a little forced, but i loved them all anyways. the combat is brutal and involving, though the 'boss' fights are all very similar and easy. i hated for it to end, and honestly hated the ending, not because it was bad, but because of what happened.. you need to see it yourself. i had a lot of doubts for this game after seeing the movie, but this game was amazing. for example, i got mgsv and this at the same time. after putting around hours into each, i just left mgsv alone. mad max was so much more interesting and adrenaline fueled. if you're on the edge, i say buy the game. if you love gritty worlds and extremely satisfying car and land battles, it's worth it.",1
"absolutely fantastic game! as a fan of detective shows and movies, this game was perfect for putting me into the action as a detective. though there are a considerable number of cutscenes, you really feel like you are in the action when solving cases. from searching for clues, to determining whether someone is lying based on their facial expressions, this is by far a great game if you want to experience the life of a detective.",1
"best submarine simulation ever. if ubisoft just transferred this game into modern graphics, it would've been awesome. instead, they killed the franchise. nuff said.",1
double fine didn't finish making this game and just handed it over too the community too finish after alpha . lost all respect for this company now.,0
an amazing game. places you in the view of the people not the soldiers so you are not a commando or fighter just a normal person.,1
"while i have played it and it is fun, it cannot run on modern hardware, it was a nightmare to set up and i couldn't deal with the crashing.",0
the menu screen is very nice and bright beautifuly done and dont forget the gameplay the main character crash screen is very common in this game the mouse controls are very nice this is about as far as i got into the game mostly because it crashed times worst preorder every this is the type of game you buy as a gift for the kids who told you santa wasnt real dont buy this game worst port of the century and even on lowest settings it crashes i did everything my specs are lightyears ahead of this game screw you ubisoft i dont want a refund i want a working game that i pre ordered and stalked for months,0
has no multiplayer its dont waste your money,0
"exceptional game. bought it on sale but it's worth normal price for sure. it has a lot of cutscenes to drive the story, and some complain about it, but it made the game even better for me. atmosphere by the buckets. character development heaven. great story. awesome ride. i was on the edge of my seat the entire gamebuy it now!!",1
frank bought me this game for and i never even played it with him so i feel really bad i'm sorry frank we can play any time you want,0
"after selling the steam cards, this game came out to about cents and given that i've already put in over an hour to the game with at least as much time left , and it's only in alpha - i'd say it's well worth purchasing. it's very simple buy weapons and baricades to kill increasingly plentiful, powerful, and speedy horde of zombies until you're eventually overrun. there are a few obtainable achievements making it a good game for metagamers looking for an easy stats booster, and its simplicity lends itself to a quick play timetable making it perfect for random dull spots in your day.",1
"luftrausers keeps crashing after the start-up press x to continue, press x to continue, then an image of a dude, and then the crash ? i hope you guys can fix this for me, because i really want to play the game!",0
"when you die, start as a new squirrel every time -clunky controls -not really interesting",0
"honestly, this game isn't bad, but it's no sid meier's civilization game, either. missing many of the core features from the previous games that we loved, and adding instead bloated systems that seem meaningless in comparision, this isn't a game i can recommend to any fan of the civilization series.",0
are you a fan of story-rich game? well this is the game for you. the ending,1
"i liked the game and initially gave it a thumbs up, however once ascension came out i felt cheated and robbed, everything ascension is this game should have been and i felt as though the company screwed me out of money to raise money for ascension, all real development efforst shifted to ascension, and they have yet to release a upgrade mod for this space hulk game. play ascension, not this game.",0
only worthwile if you see it as a casual game and don't compare it with civ and similar games.,0
"the second season is significantly shorter than the first, which is a shame. my playthrough of the first game lasted about hours. this one initially took about hours, quite a difference! the hub segments aren't as involved gameplay-wise or that large this time around, thus factoring into the length of the game. the quality of the story and the interaction within it is as grippingly good as before.. perhaps even more intense. having finished the second season days ago, i'm still feeling somewhat empty after it ended. it doesn't happen very often, that a game leaves such a lasting impression.",1
definatly not reccomended. it seems like a cute little platformer at first but less than a minute into the game and you figure out that the controlls are sub-par especially when the egg just straight up stops moving and just hops up and down in one place. i'm not one to give up on games but i can tell that this one is not worth it even for how cheap it is.,0
"i was looking forward to playing the product version. however they added acid thingy while i wasn't playing this game. i quit playing this game because of this acid element. some zombies left acid when they die. if you step on it, you take damege, multiple times while you are on it. when your character die on acid, you would revive the character. then revived character take acid damage, and die again sometimes. i really hate this acid element enough to write this negative review. i don't understand why this annoying element was added. this game was fun without this annoying element.",0
"nobody's playing multiplayer because ea is a steaming pile of , i've tried several times, and it keeps tellin me my cd key is used. thankfully it's singleplayer may be worth buying if it's on sale, but if you want this game's classic multiplayer experience, you're outta luck.",0

"i've never been all that into tower defense games. and i don't think i'll get into them anytime soon. but this game? this game is so much more. it combines tower defense, fps and multiplayer in an awesome and addicting way. first, build the maze. second, weaponize the out of it. third, let the hordes in and blast away. it is so satisfying to watch wave after wave of alien invaders succumb to your labyrinth of death. nothing like shooting one in its weakspot for the kill. and seeing your name come up at the end of the round as dps master is a nice little ego boost. i can't sing this game's praises loud enough. out of would shoot a spore pod in the face again",1

"imbalanced sack of . i get on every week or so and hope i might be able to play a fun equal match where i have any chance of winning and everytime i'm either matched aginst top ranked players or dropped into in-progress lossing matches. maybe the expansion will fix some of this, but i doubt it due to a new naut being ted. ted has a low cooldown high damage skill that takes up a large naut worth of screen space and goes through anything. most characters have a damage skill that they have to aim and land, not ted, his just goes in one big damage beam right through the entire map. so, in short, this game and it's balance. pick it up if you only want to play overpowered t characters so you can make your feel bigger. if you want to play interesting characters with a variety of skills, look somewhere else. gnaw, ted, and coco are the only nautws you'll ever need.",0

"doesn't work with trackir, boo!",0
"this game is awesome. it is very funny and, if you don't pee your pants from anger of dying its even better.",1
this game caught my eye at first .. so i bought it . cheap as.. i like supporting indie game's like this one.. sweet concept on the game i can fly a rc copter without paying alot for a descent toy fly around my back yard.. review the game.. well if your into trying to control a rc copter with back to front controls .. a xbox has buttons and yet the buttons are useless and there no way to remap the controls.. so im in free fly mode to get some practice and omg battery starts at and last minutes i think i should go buy a toy copter wait hours for it to charge and use it for minutes.. i realise this game is new.. so my honest opinion for this game is dont buy it watch youtube videos of games before wasting . im going to keep this game for the fact that the developers need input and more ideas.. number one on the list is increase battery level to not restric users to minutes of flight.. number two o the list should be a feature to allow customization and a bigger battery clearer controls,0

"same thoughts as meny others here, negative reviews clearly don t understand the game and its point, but somethng is clear, the game is not for everyone, and certainly not for people expecting an easy ride. the game is difficult, even in 'easy' mode, it s almost a tabletop interactive rpg experience, where the dm laughs at you while he makes your game miserable by trying to make you lose.. its almost like the game is about losing the least possible to just make it through amazing game, great conecpt, great musing, a refreshing dose of 'something else' in the gaming world.",1

this game is a must have for fable fans and to people that haven't had a chance to experience fable in the past. i have been a fan of the fable series since fable came out on the original xbox. i have played every fable that has come out other than fable the journey so i think that it is okay for me to say that this is the best one yet and is wonderful edition to my fable collection on both my xbox and pc. this game has wonderfully remastered visuals and audio that will take your breath away when thinking about the first fable in comparison. i spent a lot of time in the beta for this game playing for countless hours because i could not get enough of it. so if you are going to take someones opinion of this game it should be the guy with almost hours played! goodhero,1

very fun and challenging enough to keep you interested.,1
"it's not a bad game, but why is there no jumping or platforming? the auto run system isn't very robust, unlike assassin's creed.",0
"this is the first visual novel that i ever played besides watching others on youtube, and all i can say is that this game i love it. the soundtrack is so compatible with the lovely artwork, and characters. i recommend that you do all the routes including the secret endings so that you get a better understanding of the game and i hope there are more like this.",1
"this game is just.. i just dont like it. i cant play it cause , it has block graphics, it really should be improved, ive seen games that are amazing, and another thing, this game has no lands, you have too create it all on your own, i would like the game too have something fun to do besides build. i know my time is . hours on record but thats cause i tried too play it, i liked it for the first minutes and got bored of it, i wish there was crafting and stuff like that, and i know it says it has freedom too design but its a bit too much freedom, it feels boring when someone does this sort of thing. it was good for minutes, then i quit, just does not have any great stuff too look forward too and may i add, they havent done a patch since , and its almost now. so please do not buy this game if you want multiple patches every so often.",0
"i could barely play the minutes that i got due to the fact that the game starts in this resolution and everything is too small. and if you resize the window, the game crashes. so yeah, big 'no' for me. however, the dev is remaking the game and releasing it for free to owners of the original. so maybe there's some promise there.",0
"it's ok. i get the impression english isn't the writer's first language, though, and it comes off a little too disjointed.",0
"this game may well be great. i wouldn't know, because i'm unlikely to play much of it, since doing so requires using ubisoft's awful, awful 'service' uplay. i guess it's partly my fault for not reading the system requirements closely enough. my computer has no trouble handling modern games, so i thought it unnecessary, but that's the only place you'll see any warning about uplay. well, fool me once, shame on you. i won't be purchasing another game with ubisoft's name on it until they pull a gfwl on uplay. the sooner the better.",0
the script looked like it was written by a year old just introduced to the internet and i got curious.. my questions were answered in the end.,1
campaign? nah just make your story in multiplayer! here's mine as i stood on top of a moving enemy tank i looked at all the enemies who only looked at my hands seeing i had grasped the c to their doom. my team won of course. only bad part is we need more people to play with .,1
one of the best free adventure rpg based games on steam.can't wait to try ebf !,1
"developers don't care, support is not guranteed in the future. beware power creep in the dlc, and terrible balancing.",0
"this still doesn't work on windows . edit so i caved and downloaded the fan files that make the game playable. i still do not recommend this game, though. why would anyone sell a game that takes effort to even start? as far as the gameplay goes, the intro has a unique and exciting setup. but the controls seem to be terrible with no part of the game telling you what's what. from experimenting, to pick stuff up, you click the mouse and press forward. to climb a ladder, you hold the mouse and press forward. to equip a sword, you click the mouse and press forward. compared to modern games, this is awkward and messy. hopefully the game itself will rise above its controls. i'll update more as i play. walking around trying to get favor with the old camp, i run into a bug bloodfly that one shots me. that kind of gameplay is ludicrous. nobody warned my character at all about these monsters.",0
"the game play is great, the visuals are awesome but the choices.. the choices are what makes this game stand out. nothing is simple, sure, sure, sometimes monsters are just that, but other times the humans are far worse.. and sometimes you are the worst monster of all.. but all for the greater good. right? right. at least that is what i tell myself so i can sleep at night.",1
you don't play this game. this game plays you.,1
"shadowrun returns is a good game but shadowrun dragonfall is a great game! it is very well written, has a complex and engaging story with some great characters even though i felt some of them could have been explored some more . the combat is fun and on hard and very hard tactics are very much needed. one of the best rpg's i've had the pleasure of playing in a long while. highly recommended!! also check out the workshop there is some great user created content there too, nightmare harvest is very good but there are a few to choose from.",1
"it's a very good game with a impressive story. unfortunately, the software has bug such as cannot exit and the mouse focus. but it also worth to buy if u like to see a simple and moving story.",1
after all this time i thought the game was working properly so i gave it a go..nope. after a couple of hours of play the game keeps crashing. no possible fix found anywhere online. i'm just going to give up on this one. if they have not fixed it by now i won't hold my hopes up any more.,0
i'd have more hours but my mom is home most of the time.,1
get all the dlc its a waste of money if you dont.,1
pretty boring to sit there and watch the drill drilling through the wall.,0
amazing game out of because of bugs but otherwise great,1
"single player rocks. online described in one word waiting, its terrible.",1
i downloaded this game to play with a friend. the glyph launcher put us in different unknown regions when we both had our regions selected to na. anything that trion world touches dies.,0
it is remarkably therapeutic pretending to be a goat. a remarkable amount of stress can be relieved by strapping a rocketpack to a farm animal and charging the little head first off of a sky scraper. the guys that made this are geniuses. definitely worth a purchase!,1
for me this game is boring and not fun,0
"idea is fine, but repetitive.",0
"i posted a bad review for this game, expressing my opinion - and got flamed for it. if like the game, fine, you're not going to make me like it any more by being jerks. i removed the other review - i hope you're happy.",0
"the game is not worth it, its basicly the exact same as mowas with worse performance. i lost faith in digitalmindsoft.",0
"i was a ac fan before this game. after playing first ac, i bought ac and brotherhood on release day and did not play anything else until i finished them. i had same excitement and motivation for ac revelations. note that i live in area where this game takes place. so, i was looking forward to travel my suburbs with ezio in ottoman era. after playing half of the game i suddenly stopped playing. it was just same, same, same.. days ago i decided to continue just because i wanna complete the game before i delete it. i don't know the story, don't know who is who and don't care indeed. i miss the feeling i had in ac but my ac adventures stopped before even finishing this game. such a pitty.",0
i bought this game at a discounted price and it was without a doubt worth every penny. if you are considering buying this game do no let the price discourage you from doing so because if you know you will enjoy the game it is worth the price.,1
"no dedicated server support in multiplayer. not only does this mean there is virtually no ability to play on custom user created maps unless you play locally but it means you get put in games with no attention to connection issues, skill level or map choice. this one thing alone ruined it for me. if this doesn't bother you i'd say it's a great game, all of what you'd expect from the cod series. haven't gotten much into the single player campaign yet but what i've played has been pretty decent.",0
"meh, in my opinion this game is extremly overrated. bioshock amp was very good but this got really repetetive and dull after a coupple of hours playing. this game is a good example of how delevopers doesn't really care about what the fans want and just tries to put something different and new together. worth a shot but wouldnt recommend this if you think its going to be like the earlier games, doesn't really has that bioshock feel to it. great story but the gamepaly ruins it. out of",0
"i love tropico series and pre-ordered this. but, there is only one reason for my negative review dlc's. i'm not a hater, you can check my profile and can see tropico is still my top favourite game. anyway, you may want to buy it but i can tell you, wait for the complete edition. there are a lot of dlc's and without dlc's the game is not complete. well, you can buy dlc's or you can buy 'tropico -pack' timesfor sales.",0
"very fun, very responsive gameplay. a vive must have!",1
"you don't know pain, if you haven't played dead bits.",0
"you like the walking dead season ?that's good man that's good,because this game right here will satisfy your needs if you still haven't had enough with twd s and s .this one is the story a sherriff named bigby trying to solve a murder case.you'll be facing a lot of major choices more than the twd season .with every episode and every second you play, it will make your jaw drop.luckily,they're still using the comic-book graphics which i really like.you'll be forced with major choices which then you'll need to pause the game and think about it carefully because that affects your storyline.with episode which came out so fast.i think we can see episode get released - months again.but if you don't like waiting,you can buy this game after the episode came out which i really recommend. out of .better than twd imo",1
"uninstalled due to pay mod. get ed, valve.",0
"it's awesome, as long as it works. no patch? no recommendation. broken multiplayer, memory leak, resulting performance issues within an hour at maximum. it's an awesome game, maybe a bit slow, don't get me wrong, but as long as it sucks technically it is nothing you should buy without trying beforehand.",0
"this game feels like a really, really, really, bad acid trip. also there is a horrible blur effect over most of the screen and all the models look like cheap knockoffs you find at a flea market",0
too good to be true,1
lovely little game. worth the money.,1
"this game is so boring. the voices for all the characters besides the transistor sound awful it hurts just listening to them. the bad script didn't help either. most of the time you will be walking through levels pretty much the same as the previous, coming across terminals filled with boring dialogue. the actual combat is easy. there are special 'backstage' bonus challenges to complete, but those just feel tedious. the dialogue is bad, the art is repetitive, and the combat is boring. the only good thing about this game is the soundtrack. not only that, the lead up to the different bosses is executed so poorly. i killed the st boss without realising that it was a boss. maybe it's because she looked just like everyone else or because there was no build up to the battle. the next bosses did kind of have a build up, but when the time came to finally fight them, they had committed suicide. how boring. yeah i could fight them, or i could walk in on their dead bodies. the only boss done well was the final boss.",0
"i must saw, the story of this game is great. culturally enriching in a way that few other games are. the gameplay, however, is absolutely horrid. the game attempts to hold your hand every step of the way. unfortunately, when the hand lets go the game is brutally punishing. the camera pans in the wrong direction making it extraordinarily hard to complete a simple objective, and the 'last boss' fight is needlessly difficult. everything seems to function at a snail's pace, leaving very little up to skill. not recommended.",0
"it's like robo craft but terrible, the only two good things about this game is the maps and graphics comperd to robo craft.",0
keeps freezing end of turn!,0
"mass effect is an epic game in its own right. travel throughout the galaxy trying to track down saren, who wants to overthrow the galaxy. during this journey, commander shepard you will encounter friend and foe and get a few interesting companions, like liara, garrus, wrex and tali you'll also unlock new abilities and outfits. engage in interesting conversations that allow you to learn more about the universe of mass effect, and take down saren's threat by finding the mysterious conduit and figuring out why the bad guy is doing all of this. mass effect is a game with a lot of charm. i've finished the story twice and i am planning to finish it quite a few times more with different classes. it is well replayable, since there are two karma lines and each mission can be approached differently depending on how you like to play the game. it's the kind of game you shouldn't miss. a single playthrough is about hrs. replayability approx. hrs, if not more.",1
"this just doesn't work for me. it gets past the cryptic screen, and then.. boom. error x a . i googled it, came up with nothing helpful. apparently this is a problem that happens just not to me, but to many others as well. and then after it crashed for the nth time, steam got convinced i was still playing. even though it wasn't open. i looked through the task manager, tasklist on the command promt, everything, and it wasn't open. so i now have . hours on a game i haven't spent three minutes actually playing. or one for that matter. so well done, thanks for getting my hopes up. and then smashing them into nothingness. all because of one simple error.",0
"this is probably the most intense, exciting and frustrating game ever. great fun, smooth simplistic gameplay yet really hard to master.",1
one of the greatest games of all time.,1

buggy crap that won't even start..,0
"what the heck wus i just playing? ok, first off the good. the landscape looks wonderful. that's it. honestly. yes there are bits of some story, personal drama in the lives of people. but you can't change it, influence it, reverse it, nothing. you just witness something that unchangingly happend and you have zilch influence on the ending or on anything. the world is full of stuff, which none it you can touch or use, with the exceptions of radios and telephones which give short messages. so you just passively hear a story of stuff that happened to people, none of which gets resolved. i don't want to spoil the ending, but i can say that the ending didn't make any sense unless you like hippie new age crap. no solution, no tangible effect of you being there. it seems to be nice at first, but it drags on and on and it was way too much like a christian-hippie-kumbaya pr in my face for me to like it. i really prefer games where i bloody actually do stuff and make at least some change to this or that side.",0
the nd best tw game ever.,1
"ok im going to get right to the point. theres a lot of cheaters when i say a lot i mean a hell of a ing lot boring ai boring loot system you have to pay to buy keys to open some things to get guns half arsed attempt at making a game. the game was great in its beta very early beta. when the first beta came out and you had to have an invite key or whatever it was so much fun. loot was balanced and ai wasn't ing dumb. now after the updates they ruined everything, loot, ai, servers and even the bloody launcher if you like survival games which i do dont play it. it ruins the whole experiance for you.",0
"its not bad it could use more units per faction nice graphics had fun mabye lower price some i enjoyed it starting to run smoother factions are all fun to play, but more would be great",1
"i must say, i'm thoroughly enjoying sniper elite . the devs stepped it up on this sequel. they took everything we loved from v and made it better, while adding new features systems to give it a more stealthy feeling, which i love. and it's running on ultra with zero performance issues on my old gtx .",1
"had to restart my computer in order shut down the game, don't think that's a good first impression.",0
"first time around, i uninstalled the game after minutes. the animations looked stupid. i got killed instantly as always in mp fps . but people kept praising this game. when rising storm came out i gave it another try - and fell in love. turns out, it was me, who was stupid - not the game. this game makes you 'earn' your kills. and every bullet counts. make sure to take cover while reloading, unless you want to die. it does only 'one' thing, but it does it right. one of the finest shooters, you can buy. excellent sound design, voice acting and a great 'natural' flow of tactical gameplay. i rarely play multiplayer fps, but this game is an exception. the cover system feels great amp should be implemented in all games.",1
compared to human revolution this game really sucks. very bad gameplay and controls due to beeing a port of a game developed for mobile devices. i really regret buying this waste of time and money.,0
"i hated this game at first, but once i upgraded to a gaming rig amd quad core gtx ultra graphics with no major problems. i have to say if you want to play the game the way its meant to be, then upgrade to a beefy rig. realistic and much more refined with the updated emporer addition. a must have for true fans of the series.",1
the game itself is fun. but i could not launch it through steam. i had to download a external launcher to play.,0
"this game is fun to begin with, but unless you want to mess around with all the guns, gets boring fast as you play the same missions over and over in the same place to get the best men or weopons. it's even more repetative than ubisoft titles in my opinion. just the worst metal gear game i have ever played other than maybe peace walker which i could accept its faults for being on a old handheld device.",0
"the first few hours, i found myself genuinely interested but that slowly dwindled away as i realized the game was the same mechanic, wash and repeat for hours. the plot was somewhat complex, which i admire, however it became incredibly absurd. at one point, the main character suddenly does something completely out-of-character and way out in left field. honestly, the facial animations are good but the face textures are just god awful that it takes away. the city feels barren, the color palette is lackluster, the npcs all seemingly have the same lines, driving from point a to point b was incredibly boring, and i could go on and on. this is a complete game, but man what a borefest. i found myself anticipating the ending so much just so i could get my closure and move on.",0
pros cons - perfect for a mba student personal opinion - do not go on the name of the game littlelycanreviewsonsteam date - march rating - out of,0
when you're to poor to buy css and include microtransactions,0
"i'd like to reccomend this game, but i only got minutes of gameplay before i lost connection. this happens every match, please fix it.",0
"huge fan of konami's track and field and hyper sports arcade games. this is worse. i was able to play three events -- high jump, swimming, and m dash -- winning the third. there's no frame limiter, so it's just running at fps. crashed to desktop twice the first fifteen minutes. it isn't horrible, i'd start it up again, and at least play through every event once, but crashes kill my motivation. the bottom line is that i'd rather uninstall it than contact tech support.",0
"i love this game . the problem is, the more arkaine try to fix the poor performance, the more they break the game and make it run worse. before i had really poor framerates and broken mouse input, then with the first beta patch they fixed the mouse and i got acceptable framerates. now i have acceptable framerates with terrible frametimes which makes the game judder like i'm operating heavy machinery whilst i'm trying to play it. it's the first time in years of gaming i've seen something so badly nauseating. it was so shockingly unplayable i asked my wife to have a look and she instantly went 'ugh!', so its not just my eyes playing tricks. i have a hz gsync monitor and the hardware to push current aaa games mostly around fps, so this isn't my hardware playing up, and i have the latest nvidia drivers installed. the problem also happens with the beta patch in place and when it's removed. i can not recommend anyone to buy this game on pc in it's current state. stay away unless you like being ripped off.",0
"fun game, played with my nephew lol",1
it's fun but the wait time is so ing ridiculous like i can't even get into the game without waiting and hour or more to play.,0
"now, portal is one of those rare games that makes its predecessor completely obsolete. there are more puzzles, more characters, better graphics and sound, more variables in the puzzles, and a surprising story that went above and beyond my expectations. unfortunately, once you ve beaten both campaigns, there s nothing left to do. even with that shortcoming, however, portal is one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences i ve had for quite a while. i'm not going to shout about how great this game is. il let you find out!",1
"i was hoping for more from this game. a tale of a man who has taken a 'time out' from his life due to circumstances, the game suffers from up syndrome where all the best stuff is in the first ten minutes and is never matched by anything that comes after. it's a story of two people bonding over a summer, and if the game had done more with this central relationship then it might have worked. unfortunately most of this bonding is skipped over and you're plunged into a conspiracy which is really there just to give you something to react to, and which doesn't hold up to much thought. in the end it just doesn't add up to a satisfying experience. it doesn't spend enough time developing - or even give you enough scope in shaping - the relationship to work from a narrative perspective, and there's really nothing for you to do from a game perspective.",0
"for the price this game is ok. if you want a short and sometimes frustrating diversion, then maybe buy it. for me, i would have rather not. shame there isn't a vote maybe option.",0
game looks great but runs awful even after playing with settings. running gtx which gets significantly smoother gameplay out of even a game like crysis . this game is not optimized all that great for pc at all. for the price tag that i purchased it for this is a huge let down.,0
very fun alot of grinding but can be worth it,1
had trouble to get download proply but once done found it a game have to return to,1
"one of the best rpgs i've ever played. dwarves and elves and mages oh my! love the world-building, love that your pc can have six very different origin stories that come into play later in the game as you gather allies and love all the companions.",1
very well done early access game takes forever on some of the fights. wish the loot was higher frequency but love fighting style and story is a bit random. also skills and points are poor layout,1
free to play why not and if u have beast pc evry thing at ultra settings this game looks gorgess,1
"if you are like me who started resident evil along time ago when shinji mikami was working with capcom, you will understand that this game completely derails off the series. this game is nothing but a hollywood blockbuster knock off, capcom is like an old dog that needs to be put out of their misery. instead of just milking the series scoffing and ignoring the core fans, they should either reboot the game or atleast make another resident evil that follows their main foundation of the series and i believe it is 'resident evil remake'. oh did i mention that they should just rename this game to 'resident evil identity crisis'? now that is horrific!!",0
i recommend you do not buy this game,1
"a game that was a semi-broken, buggy mess at release, but one that has been greatly improved through the efforts of a modding community that seem to care far more about the franchise than the developer did. not worth the money at release but definitely worth it now for a good story in a great and zany setting",1
"this is how i hope 'godus' will feel like playing. it's a.m. in the morning now because i prefaird do watch that tiny people instead of the time. highly recomend even if you are not the biggest fan of god-simulations. this is worth playing. i love the style and gameplay mecanism, but i need a bigger planet and more time",1
ing better than cs go..,1
"i belive this game has so much more to improve. aside from the laggy and full servers, it's a good game, has a lot of potential.",1

no because servers are down and you can't login to live you rockstar go hang you'r self,0

"because certain items bound to only get dark zone without having fun and standing purpose is geot also displeased that encourage pvp too, so you america and the idea that the contribution from haneungeo encourage pvp on the road this game is a lot geot murder crimes fun anhalt is because i think the game will be played if a refund",0
"this game is a total dota ripoff. though i didnt put much time into it, i could already tell it was such a dota reskin. that is all i have to say.",0
this game is terrible. i thought the handling was the only thing wrong with this monstrosity however trying to play racing was bull crap because on about the th or th mission your placing in the race gets glitched and you never start a new lap. i loath this game and it's not fun.,0
"damn this game got me hooked! amazing artstyle, with good humor here and there. pretty nice soundtrack. solid, fun gameplay. controller recommended and a very fun local coop gameplay! it is really a blast if you play it with a good friend! out of strongly recommended for everyone who likes games of this type!",1
hope you like using a mouse and keyboard to drive,0
"i fired this bad boy up hoping for some of the much-hyped kitschy source material with a well-rounded gameplay experience. if you release a game in , it ought to be technically superior to games years older. i felt like i was playing a croatian version of neverwinter nights . crap graphics and boring combat didn't do anything to make the expansive content palatable. i assume there was expansive content because the few missions i did went on and on and on. the first random encounters i had all played on the exact same tileset. so, basically punishment. yawn. i don't play games to give my time away generously, i pay money for first-rate interactive entertainment. anything less than that is a serious failure in this current generation of technology. plenty of shoulders for game devs to stand on -- no excuse for lack of innovation. sorry. better luck next time.",0
this game is linear and repetitive. the lack of auction house is pointless. i got bored with the game within a week and went back to my mount and blade mods. people who claims that this game is better than the launch version are lying to themselves. this game is btp because people don't stick around too long so it's pointless to offer a monthly subscription.,0
graphics are horrible. the games controls are so bad.,0
"lol, cant find any opening multiplayer session for raid mode, to play it fun you have to play it with friends. too many collective items made me hard to enjoy the game shooting emblems, finding bugs, complete medal challenges and etc etc , hence i can't say the game is survival oriented. if you just want to know the story, head to youtube and watch those play throughs, not worth to buy it.",0
"co-op survival horror makes a great game, especially when you can kill specimens with your buddies almost anytime. i've always loved playing with other players simply because it's really really fun, i could play this game for a year and not get bored a single bit. hope anyone who have never play or doesn't have this game tries it out. good luck with the flesh pounds !",1
no steam cloud save!! please ..,0
"i guess i was in a pirate phase when i bought this. in retrospect, the game is too simple and the depth is equivalent to a puddle vs. an ocean. kinda embarased i bought this game.. maybe my kid will like this game when they turn .",0

"dont buy it, dont waste your time or money. this game hasnt worked right since it launched.",0
"my pc has an amd fx- cpu and a r x gpu, which is a few years old and only a mid upper-mid tier card. running the game so far on 'high' with msaa off and im getting fps which i'm more than happy with since this is a brand new game running on a . year old pc. game play wise, controls feel very similar to human revolution as does the combat and all around mechanics. nothing too clunky only thing i needed to adjust was the mouse sensitivity which was very high at first launch. the new hud layout is appealing and updated along with the aug upgrade layout. the story is as engaging as ever in the deus ex series, still maintaining what i believe is a great balance of a captivating plot and player's ability to affect the plot given their in-game decisions. i haven't paid much attention to the dlc yet but i don't think they add or take away from the core experience. greatly recommend this game.",1
"perfect game if you have some minutes spare or even for some longer gaming seasions. easy to learn hard to master, but anyways lots of fun especially when playing with friends.",1
this is the greatest spooky game of all time!,1
"what the hell have you done!! this is not the way homm should be, bugy as hell?? why did they mess it up? i want my money back!",1
i like hot double-d lady! pack of beer! and not this game!,0
"endless space a nice turned base galactic empire building strategy game. the developers have done a nice job with the mechanics and they offered new insight as the had a very transparent development process. if your a fan of more of the management and development side of strategy games i highly recommend this game. it not only lets you play the military conquest way but balances tech, culture, and diplomatic routes. user interface is really well done allowing easy navigation and displaying of informations. the ability to make custom races is nice and the the customizations of ships is great for catering vessels for your battle tactics. it has that 'just one more turn' magic that makes you wonder how it is already am.",1
"this game has a very nice story and an incredible atmosphere, mostly due to it's very nice and classical soundtrack, but also because of the visuals. to be honest, i didn't think an rpg maker game could be made to feel this atmospheric. this game will make you think and at times might even make you cry. i definitely recommend it.",1
"game has no fps cap, expect to be running at yes, actually four thousand frames per second and running your gpu well past c. even with nvidia d management, and precision evga fps limiters, the game uncaps itself after switching rooms. so, nothing works to limit fps. anyone who plays this game is probably clueless as to what it is doing to their computers and gpus. and that is, destroying them slowly. another excercise in poor development. do not play.",0
i love this game is so beautiful and well made i really love it lt,1
"i love this game, a ton of replayability, major endings with loads of minor faction endings and great companion interactions. it does have bugs, but nothing game breaking seeing as how most bugs have been patched out",1
"it's still civ with all the old game mechanics starting with one city and expanding borders , but it just doesn't appeal to me. the tech 'tree' or tech web, as it is refered to in the game is confusing, the ui colours are just a no-go violet over a blue background? ouch! , and you are being fed too much information in a very short time span to consider it a 'fun' experience. so if you like futuristic games and have a lot of time on your hand to learn about the new units, techs, etc, well then go for it. i personally don't like to spend more than minutes to learn about the ins and outs of a game, especially for one in a series which i'm very familiar with.",0
"i just downloaded this during the free weekend. i really wanted to like buy this game, but i was only able to play freaking game. after that it would freeze on trying to load me into a lobby. another time it joined then said i got disconnected because it couldn't connect to the anticheat? after multiple attempts and min later i am uninstalling this.",0
looks like the best one imo,1
half life is one ofthe best games i have ever played for me i will rate this game out of,1
"act is fantastic, but act takes everything that act set up and drives it straight into the ground. characters cease developing, game becomes hours of walking and backtracking and trial and error, with puzzles that border on moon logic being sprinkled about. the ending fails to actually bring anything in the story to conclusion whatsoever, with act only adding more gaps in the plot that are never discussed, covered, or concluded in any way shape or form. some characters even had their personalities from act negated or ruined. act ruined this game completely, and it is not worth purchasing whatsoever anymore. double fine has fallen far and hard.",0
can i get the money back.. how can i do that,0
wow such winterbottom very pie good game do want,1

"i got this game to play with my friend. had fun for a while. a lot of my time just came from tedious grinding for levels to unlock to stuff and to get money. toxic community, tons of hackers who are either nice or . rockstar has the iest support ever. i've been temp banned twice now for no reason at all. their support seems to be a bot telling you no you cannot get a temp ban appeal. there isn't a lot to do in free roam. you can around with friends, or do online mini-games. it's fun to do that but it won't last for ever. i did enjoy it for a little bit, but like i said. it doesn't last for ever. it get's boring. out of",0
i want delete this game,0
i just purchased this game and everytime i attempt to play it the game crashes i get my charecter built and right after i click play it loads then quits saying theres an error.. very unsatified..,0
"after a greatly needed . patch the game is slowly beginning to redeem itself from its terrible release. glad to see that hello games has not abandoned there paying customers. originally this game had recieved star from me, now i will grant them one star more for the large much needed . update. also i will add another star more for them showing that they are not abandoning the game or its community comepletely. this leaves 'no man's sky' with a three out of five star review from me. this game has much more potential and alot more room to grow. there are more stars to be had hello games. i will gladly provide them with more future updates.",1
you really gotta pay if you wanna be good at this game.,0
cant join any games. nice. out of,0
"i dont write reviews, normaly. but i was realy positivly surprisesed that long live the queen was in my update row today. its nov . years since the game came out. and they still maintain it. without having mmo, dlc, gosh, multiplayer at all. its a cute, kind, funny and entertaining queen-simulation. made with love. and you can feel this fact. thank you hanako games.",1
"i feel like this game deserves another shot. now that the base building is in the game now, it is much better. this is one of many more planned updates. this should have been the version everyone started playing. p.s- to all the haters, why not make your own game? i'm sure it would be much better than this one!",1
"ok, so it is more like an interactive movie than a game, completely on rails with not a whole lot of choices given to you, but you know what? i'm alright with that, because the experience was well worth it regardless. if you enjoy the books and or show and want to feel like you're a part of the world, or even just want more story while you wait for your next fix, then this will definitely be a good choice. i was excited, anxious, shocked, and fearful while playing. knowing what i do about various characters and storyline already made it easy to fall into the action and have it be believable. i felt for the characters and cannot wait for the next installment to see what happens next.",1
this is a great game to play with friends it lots of fun. well as long as you dont play against the russians as there op as and will ruin your experience with the game and make u want to playing.,0
"great tactical space battles with all the requisite graphical effects, the ability to play as an tactical, engineering or science captain, each with varying abilities and customizable appearance with many parameters , and greatly improved and satisfying squad-based ground combat add up to one very entertaining free-to-play mmo. highly recommended.",1
"i can't recommend killer is dead for two important reasons. the port, for one thing, is abysmal. it's locked-down, and if you're nearer to the minimum specs you'll find it hard to get playable framerates. content-wise, killer is dead is a real mixed bag. it's incredibly stylish, and interesting in it's obscure storytelling and themes. however, the gameplay is just a bit dull. it's a bare-bones hack and slash it is perfectly serviceable, but it hardly draws you in. additionally, the bizarre, juvenile 'date' missions are just repellent. unless you're a sexually frustrated teen, they are extremely offputting and downright odd, particularly given their essential nature if you hope to progress through the story at a decent rate. i wouldn't buy killer is dead, and certainly not on pc.",0
people who were attached to the companion cube and were saddened by it should not play this game. it will break them permanently.,1
i can't recommend this game solely based on the fact that the ending is so unsatisfying that it makes my blood boil,0
"old school action with some updated modern visuals and features. great game, albeit a little short. this is what duke nukem forever should have been.",1
pretty good game. you can fly helicopters and and its better than cod. out of ign,1
"i only played this because a friend bought it for me and guilted me into actually starting it. i've never really cared at all about batman. however, this game was quite a lot of fun. the combat was very satisfying, and it turns out that being batman is kinda cool.",1
"easy to learn, tough to master. whats not to like?",1
this game crashes my pc all the time. unable to play. money thrown out the window. pathetic.,0
its ok. could use a tutorial.,1
love this game who does'nt like to watch a backflipping goat get hit by a car. no story to game but who needs it when your a goat.,1
about the depth you expect from a touch device game.,0
"a gorgeous, charming and difficult on the higher difficulty game that drew me in immedietly. it has a beautiful artstyle, looking very much like a fairy tale combines with beautiful, mostly relaxing, music. the combat is your typical turn-based rpg with a twist a timeline showing who's up next which you in different ways can manipulate depending on your attacks and abilities. if you want an rpg with a twist and an amazing style and sound i highly reccomend this. and please play on the higher difficulty.",1
logic is convoluted in dark souls . want a challenge? go try the first. want amazing sceneries? you'll like either. would you like some salt with your multiplayer? this will suffice.,1
"dead island mirrors edge, but x better.",1
"awesome!! the sounds, the vehicle design visually satisfying! warning to all history buffs the realism of some tanks battles aren't true to history. f.x. a t- destroying a t- from a distance of more than mtrs.. just remember the level of your crew and tank tier has a lot to say in battle- and team work makes all the difference!! with that in mind, best free to play ever! i've had this game for some time now, and each time i play, i get the same excited feeling in my gut, as when i played 'soldiers' as a child",1
"this is a game i played with my younger siblings when we were all pretty young. now, years later my son loves it however.. that moment when you realize all of your steam friends can you see you've been playing 'fatty bear's birthday surprise' i hope my child fully appreciates this! haha",1
"fun, but ultimately another choppy unity engine game that i can't recommend out of performing too poorly even on lowest settings to be played comfortably. game performance got worse over time, as well it at least ran at a bareable framerate when i got my hours ingame but now, revisiting it almost a year after release and on stronger hardware, it runs like . devs need to just stop using this horrid engine. initial load and any instances of loading will also leave you sitting at your computer for a minute waiting.",0
this game is my childhood! i just love it d,1
this game is cool alot of fun,1
great game to sit back and drive a truck.,1
the first minutes are great. after that it becomes boring.,0
no ultrawide support. developers support is non existent about further patches about it.,0
"honestly, i dont really like the game. i hate how you have to pay for memberships so you can hunt different animals other than rabbits and mule deer . everything that costs money is so expensive as well. i rate the game a out of .",0

random bad review reveal revoted.,0
"i really like arcade, destruction and battle racing games, but this is just sooooo boring. the demo was boring but i thought it would be better later. after a few 'races', nope, still bored to death. i think the big problem is that it's too realistic for an arcade game. cars are slow, there isn't enough 'punch' with the collisions, maybe there should be more explosions, big flames when we boost, it should be brutal but it's not. this game is as brutal as bumper cars, nothing more. so, that's the first thing that made me stop. to that i can add - the annoying commentator who seems to be as bored as me - the music ranging from 'meh' to 'dubstep' - sht than before - no interior view - ugly car designs full of sponsor stickers etc.",0
"the division as a concept had a lot of promise but the focus on only pvp content and an unbelievable amount of bugs and exploits, have turned this game into an utter how. if it was f p it would still struggle to survive. if a competent developer publisher made this it would be a much different game, instead you can feel ubisoftitis infesting this half-broken piece of software just like all the rest of thier recent releases. how people support this company i'll never know. it's the first time they've had my money since fc and blood dragon and they'll be waiting a long time for anymore money from me.",0
"can't even get into the game, only the launcher. then black blank screen. i have tried many different things including uninstalling deleting cached files. still nothing. i have tried for over hours now and very p'd off. this game is a pos",0
"the lack of choice is boring. the pack itself is neat, but there should be much more.",0
"this game is by far the best source mod out there. it pulls off what others have attempted and it does it well. somehow, the devs of this game did something right, something better than tf or counterstrike. this game is somehow intangibly more satisfying to play. you know the rush you get when you get a kill in an fps game? something about this game elevates that. you need to get this game out of",1
best minutes of my life.,1
"as of feb pros -the movement feels great. rolling, jumping and jumping up things flows well. -levels are well designed. -pretty graphics. cons -only a handful of the billions of weapon configs are viable. -weapon balance is way off. prepare for grenades, rocket spam and a lot of spray and pray. -they use matchmaking instead of a server browser. -the modes are just terrible. i tried to like them. blitz is a spamfest. deathsnatch neuters long range kills. extraction is ok if your teammates bother to collect the ore. if they don't you will lose. jackhammer is just terrible. take ctf and remove all skill from it and that is jackhammer. overall out of . it has potentional though. if they add regular ctf, tdm and dm. rebalance some weapons, add a few more maps and a server browser this game would be great.",0
"i couldnt get into sr for some reason, and i just couldnt get into this either. i already uninstalled it, i don't know what i was thinking when i spent the bucks. gt",0
"this version of the game has been optimized from the original, and is much easier on lesser systems. i picked it up on sale for . totes worth. if you don't already have a copy of fsx, this is a solid purchase even though it's usually .",1
a better wipeout game than most wipeout games,1
"since i've first made a review, tons of dlc has been released and i've played a metric ton of this game. loved of that time, and in that time, i convinced a number of people to buy the game and play. after today, day of crimefest , i'm changing my mind. it was said before that everything unlocked during this event's challenges would be free. it has been said before that the game would never have micro-transactions. today, the company line has changed and they've made it very clear they care only for their bottom line. i know that money makes the world go round, and a company can't operate without an influx. i've bought every dlc except the latest , and i had the intentions of rectifying that today, but this broke me. i was disappointed with the failure of infamy ., but i played on. it was minor, cosmetic, and ultimately, didn't effect my play. promising one thing and then delivering what was said to never be done, i'm done. this is absurd. unless overkill changes this decision, i think they've lost another hardcore player.",0
"this is a really, really cool journey through nostalgia.",1
best played if you don't know anything about it.,1
spooky me. but honestly a great spooky game. plenty of build up for being spooky. important to be in the spooky mindset if you really want to enjoy this game. if you don't wanna be afraid this game won't be any fun to you.,1
"i don't recommend it if you want a great fallout game. and especially new vegas are much truer to the series. most of the dialogue and meaningful choices have been stripped. its a shooter first, and rpg second. its a lot of fun to play, but its not what i was looking for from the next fallout game. its easy to compare with how skyrim was simplified compared to oblivion and morrowind.",0
"this game is great, i reccomend playing the pacifist path first as you will e confused during the genocide if you dont, and you wont get hit by the feels, this game is easy to play but hard to master and is overall a great game with story telling elements beyond compare.",1
"i play this game on android but this is a pretty bad port. they didn't even bother optimizing the game with hotkeys to deploy units, metal slug attack or scroll or make changes like the tap screen to press any button . you might as well play the mobile version if you are interested. also what is the point of medals if you can only buy new units with real money. that's crazy.",0
"i really enjoy this game. the mod support is unreal, it adds unlimited potential.",1
"adorable, relaxing, perfect break from studying for neolithic economy exams. out of would plant sing again and again.",1
"a beautiful, relaxing game. worth the low price.",1
this game may be short but hooo mama its a good game! out of,1
before i played this game i had a great fear of cats. every time i would walk to work they would stare at me with all those disapproving looks. this really did a number on my self-confidence and my feelings of self-worth. this game gave me the motivation to conquer my fears and gave me the confidence to quit my job and baskin robbins and now i am a self-employed stray cat catcher. thanks bad rats!,1

"yes, this game has very nice visuals and music but, my mac made it virtually unplayable. on average it ran on - fps so if you have a mac don't buy this and if you use a windows i strongly suggest this. lastly i know this is probably a technical issue with my computer but this hasn't happened with any other game and i checked my system info and i have met all the requirments so, i dont know whats wrong.",0
i will not recommend it because bad control system,0
a the in-game voice chat is ing horrible. b crashes every time i start the damn game.,0
normal clicker game but with some actual depth and strategy to it. very fun messing around with lineups. still have yet to try the event but the fact there is events to keep it interesting is good news.,1
chime has a very interesting concept for a puzzle game. you can play at your own pace and the music is great.,1
games fixed now. out of,1
after you go past the learning curve you can count on hours and hours of fun,1
"new update moon destroyed the game, it's now so long and boring to progress that there's hardly any point in playing it, you hit a wall at some point where progression is non existant for weeks, or months if you have a bad strategy. it's pretty obvious they just want you to purchase stuff, it's now your run of the mill mobile money grabbing game. shame, ding ding ding.",0
"great dungeon game. been playing this game forever. it is very difficult, and a high skill ceiling, and even when you are good you can still lose. very luck based as well. but not knowing what you will get makes it fun.",1
"haven't played much 'cause it's my go-to game when i have no internet but i will say the story is absolutely incredible, one of the best i've ever seen! gameplay is pretty nice, fast paced but the suppression system can get annoying. upgrades progression is nice. definitely worth the full price, absolute steal on sale.",1
you know you are doing somthing wrong when your player can start the game. these guys know how to realy do it. dank memes do not get this game! oh and also don't worry if you like disinstalling plz do so.,0
"essentially assassins creed mechanics in a lotr game. personally i was incredibly unhappy with this purchase granted i loved the early ac games . felt incredibly lack luster, the nemesis rival component is very cool, gameplay is monotonous and gets boring very quickly. story isnt good enough to make up for the arcade-like feel and lame gameplay.",0
"a wonderful hour game with lovable characters, clever dialogue with a nice mix of jokes and seriousness, and amazing graphical design. a must-buy for any of you ace attorney fans out there. the cross-examination parts were pretty straight-forward and didn't offer that much challenge, but it didn't really matter in the end, cause for me this game was all about the character interaction and the plot. the actual gameplay parts were just a nice little extra. also the soundtrack fit nicely the theme of th century france although don't expect to hear adrenaline-pumping earworms like cornered .",1
"painfully obvious it was a console port. controls are goofy, while you can remap them it still doesn't feel right. the camera is a constat nuisance. pov is lacking, and no map in some of the more open areas like the swamp towards the beginning are a bit frustrating. overall it kind of soured me as a fan of castlevania's original games.",0
"great game with simple but compelling mechanics, more depth of story as you start to get into the game, and troubling moral choices that should be less fun to make. example man and his wife were political refugees of some kind, fleeing their home country. i got tasked with examining their papers. the man's papers were in order, and as he was leaving he told me his wife was behind him in line, and to be nice to her. his wife shows up, but doesn't have the proper documentation. i denied her entry because if i let her in, i'd get a citation and not get paid my own family was starving . 'why?' she pleaded. 'you've doomed me.' out of would doom her again.",1
best humor and all around great game,1
awesome platformer. it has a kind of odd story but the environment looks great and the gameplay is fun. definatley worth it.,1
"if you're looking for adventure combine with a puzzle and action game, this game really suit you. although the action not as much as the adventure times, this game gonna make you stayed until you finish it. i do not regret bought this game because of the gameplay, it's fun and probably this is the best adventure game that i played recently. though you can't count the story because not that good. and also, the game offers the most beautiful lara croft there is and that hair.. ooohhhh",1
"could of been good, if it would not be pay to win, and if the text would have been corrected. also some vareity in the gameplay would have been cool, maybe some survival ala neo scavanger.",0
"hitman ai puts me into a rage. guards will shoot any running person immediately even if you re a law-abiding citizen and want to jog around nevsky prospect. all guards may come to your spot after you shot the target with svd while nobody saw you got there. but at the same time they don't give a sh!t when see a strange bold guy with svd in left hand and silenced beretta in the right. here is my piece of advice. forget about stealth. there is no stealth in here. just take your aks- u no, kid, it is not ak- and kill everyone you meet. thanks to god you have plenty of health and ammo.",0
"difficult is an understatement.. first three levels where fun and easy to go through, but then the fourth level came.. my gun being completely useless, having to hit those damn ducks four times before they die, while in the meanwhile cannons are shooting at me. trying to wurm my way through, to find out there are some disappearing stairs at the end of the row, having birds behind my back and toads above the stairs. and don't get me wrong i did give it a lot of tries, about a , if not more.. while the other maps just took me a few tries, this one was impossible.. well.. maybe if you give it another tries frustrated, anxious, annoyed, don't buy this game unless ur some kind of gaming god or really really patient!",0
feels like a 'complex' minecraft game. complex in that laying bricks isn't straightforward right off the bat and some of the controls i.e. changing paint colors aren't clear mousewheel changes colors .,0
"really good game, but as time goes on it gets grindy. yet i'd reccomend it, the experience is fun",1
"steam has ruined this game. what was once an excellent and fun game to play has been made unplayable with steam. textures are missing, buildings are solid grey rectangles, it crashes consistently. if you want to play this game, purchase from a different provider.",0
best game of the total war series. it is more complex but it is more realistic in my opinion. worth dollars!,1
get street fighter v don't even bother with iv please.,0
finally years after i've bought the game it's playable. version . is a finished game worth it's price.,1
"decay the mare is a horror psychological thriller game where you must solve puzzles like the old point and click games such as myst. well, it's more like a mixture of myst meets resident evil. it definitely plays like a classic, has a decent sountrack and the story is interesting. you play as an addict who is fighting his addiction. he takes medication one night and goes to bed only to find he is trapped in a nightmare he can not wake from. visually, the game is in d, but is static, similar to the way shadowgate is. there are some good moments where the music and the atmosphere really come together to give you an immersive horror experience. all in all, it isn't a bad game.",1
"amazin game. good story, has dark humor and cool multiplayer co-op its gta but way more cooler recomend buying it with dlc's because they add more story and more costumes.",1
micropayments in pve game.. go to hell overkill. and almir pls choke on all that gamble chash to death plox,0
"how on earth does this game have good reviews? i played for half an hour and realized everything so far was repetitive and pointless. its all qte, but they don't even matter, succeed or not and the dude dies. so after my moment of insight, i went to reddit and as it turns out, you could play the beginning mission for hours and have the same experience as those playing the full campaign. and my final reason for disliking this game stems from the inability to change controls, it is extremely inconvenient to my setup",0
over all not a bad game way not worth the price tag or sure but not .. combat inst terrible except that all your enemies do is ing evade.. like thats all.. it so ing infuriating.. but that aside its very adictive.,0
"as a previous arma player i couldn't wait to see the new technologies that were going to be used in arma . then i played it. from a personal point of view, this game is a complete let down to the arma series. yes it is enjoyable in some aspects, but it is nothing compared to arma oa. if you're looking for a more arcade type military game, you've found it.",0
your gonna have a bad time.,1
gameplay that never expands beyond the tutorial. no real mechanics. dull even by clicker standards.,0
unpolished and tedious. first thing in the game is a fight against ships which takes way too long to fight. you have to move a few steps and then do end turn when moving around the map even when all the enemies are dead. screen doesn't scroll to track your ship you have to scroll it awkwardly yourself with the mouse. shooting something requires two clicks. fonts are too large as if mobile port. can't recommend at all.,0
i am honestly not a romance type but this game got me good. it even got me fangirling. sadly its a short story but the story line is simple and really cute. i do not regret buying this.,1
"can't recommend this game on arch linux w irispro atm. it launches, but after hitting play from the main menu, it crashes after a minute or two on the loading screen. having played it for a bit now in windows, it feels like i have outgrown the kind of game where you are being chased by zombies you are not allowed to defend yourself against at all, so you feel helpless and scared. the atmosphere is effectively creepy and frightening though.",0
"can't get enough of this game. the soundtrack, the visuals, the gameplay, they are all just so perfect",1
"review key dos brode our reviews are simple,direct to the point that interests,an overall quality of the game and a final consideration. game hidden object bundle in genre casual graphics out of history out of gameplay out of sounds out of replayability out of final consideration this is a awesome pack of hidden object games,who likes hidden object games will love it,the games are full of things to find and the history of each one is big! completed stray souls and loved it,played all this game before steam release,so my gametime is short. very recommended",1
"uncharted waters online, despite its outdated graphics, is imo a brilliant work of art that any one with even a slight sense of adventure or love for the sea will enjoy and i highly recommend it!",1

"this software slows down the entire pc on startup, there's a massive typing input lag in all applications while this takes a few minutes to get started. i've reported it to evga a few times but there has been no response. msi afterburner works just fine, and the interface is a lot simpler to deal with than precision's 'racing car' theme.",0
"this game, this soundtrack, yesssssssss.",1
errrm it was rather okay but i 'ed the game in minutes..,0
"honestly, the game is a great all rounder. also you have the ability to play custom map games in zombies and multiplayer.",1
"i never want to be a critic and i'll never will, but i'll give this game . out of recommended",1
how do i unlock all other races for multiplayer?. love this game but this frustrates me to no end. please help?,1
"this game just sucks. im really disappointed as infinity ward was the maker and they are usually on..but this one was way off. the controls and feel are just not smooth. single player - well, the campaign is ehh. the storyline isnt all that great, and the characters are somewhat boring. the missions havent been anything like previous games where you'd want to replay them. multiplayer - here is where the sh!t really starts to stink. the mp is dead for a reason. its awful. on top of the controls and feel being off, they have piled on garbage maps. there is nothing about the mp that makes you want to play it over any of the previous cod games.",0
a fun loving game fit for the whole family.,1
good game. could be seen as a ets re-skin but feels much better. game will only get better with workshop support and a expanding map.,1
"don't buy this game if you want a fps. it's not a cod-like fps game at all,especially in survival mode. to be honest, shooting in this game feels like sh t comparing with cod. and there is no convenient path instruction in the game. what you have is just a rough compass and a notebook. and you cannot shoot when watching your compass. ammo is scarce resource. runing away is sometimes your only choice. conclusion it's a survivel roleplaying game, where you can use guns. you are a -year-old teen who born and living in the home station. for the first time, you must leave home and face with monsters and bandits in the ruins and tunnels. you are not a super solider with professional skills but a survivel struggling in the dark age.",1
- of the time im stuck in traffic -flip over every time i turn -havnt killed any hookers yet -taught me never to text and drive out of,1
there is no better arts game,1
yes it is the basic borderlands formula .. yes it has been shorter than the others .. i still am having an awesome time .. borderlands is one of my favourite games for a reason. the humor returns .. the getting of many guns returns and of coruse shooting lots of things .. not the best of the series but worth every penny i spent,1
"excellent game, redefines what an rts should be.",1
"ported my character over from ps after a friend gifted me this through steam, logged ish hours and i can tell you that after you've gotten your character over level with the nicest cars, you'll get bored and rockstar only adds large updates once in a blue moon and it's only good for - hours before it gets repetitive and boring. did i mention that rockstar doesn't let you mod your single-player experience? yeah, try to add a scripthookv.dll file from one of the gta v mods online to your base directory then load up the game, count the clock before rockstar gives you a ban from online for 'cheating'.",0
"took me hours to understand this game wasn't is not worth to buy. game itself is great, the negative thing in this game is the developers. developers takes your money, and lets you play the game, but the exploits and bugs is being abused too hard and none gives a f ck. like in all games from free reign, it has pay to win. in this game they didn't do it, but the biggest thing devs needs to do is to change their attitude and start to focus on their own made game.",0
yeeeeeah im never going to get over that bank managers face.,1
awesome game but you will need a kinda powerful computer with a dedicated graphics card for the game to run smooth.,1
"i don't really understand the point. everything is based on luck, from the map layouts to the combat system. there's not really anything else to it. if you like to just watch yourself get lucky unlucky, this is the game for you!",0
brilliantly addictive game. worth the i bought the game for and worth the price it is normally. i hope they can add some new features to the game over time to keep the game more fresh and a way to lengthen the campaign but the basic idea is great and the replayability factor is great.,1
"if you complain about tank controls, ink ribbons, or limited inventory you're a big baby this game rocks",1
this thing should be in early access,0
i wouldn't mind if the game was free but to ask for euro for a game thats minutes long is insane. there is no payoff to this so cold 'story' and if you see the trailer thats it you have seen the whole game take my advice stay clear of this game.,0
great game had it since early access play it with friends all the time i highly reccomend it to everyone who plays indie survival sandbox games with there friends,1
still a great game to play.,1
"this game was a waste of money and time. given the developers promised the role of discovery, exploration, and adventure, they aslo promised other features. all though they are technically there within the game, the universe provided is so huge that it makes the encounter of such events and opportunities so miniscule that they might as well not have even been implimented. it would have been much better if the developers created the game on a much smaller scale so that the oppourtunity of meeting other players ingame could have happened and much more features could have been intoduced. though the game does hold future potential, it might as well been classified under false advertising as so much was promised only to be a let down for many players who wanted a little more action and less running around every twenty minutes trying to find fuel for your spacecraft.",0
"this game looks like a really fun game, and it has great potential, but the problems are just too many to ignore. this is not like most city building games. your streets are already pre-defined and the buildings cannot be build just anywhere..only in the zones that they tell you that you can build in. the building selection is very small, and some of the buildings are glitchy at best. the transitions between water and land are unrealistic, and the maps have giant blank pieces in them. i have also experienced issues with the game crashing. i did like how once you built a building, you could add extras to the building to enhance it's influence. however, this also means that you really can't build and move on.. to maximize the effects of the buildings that you build, you need to customize every single one individually. imagine doing this for hundreds of buildings that you build. plus you need to moniter how each business is doing. this is far too much micromanaging for me. this game had some good parts, but i would recommend passing on this one.",0
the game wasnt bad but it lacked online multiplayer. so it wasnt for me. if you have ppl over alot and can do couch co-op it probably wouldnt be that bad,0
"really bad game. broken like their publisher's latest game, arkham knight. then they just decided to give up on the pc version of mortal kombat x. way to show loyalty to your customers. horrible netcode, the game plays as if you're under fps, and the servers run as if they're tick, just pure cancer.",0

"one of the greatest games to ever be made to date, still compared to the newest game of the year, witcher with lots more replayability, thanks to mods, great dlc and a community that is still very active, made by bethesda one of the best gaming companies to date. if you want to get into the rpg genre this is a great start, a good price for a beautiful game with countless mod support, would recommend to all lt",1
"simply put, this version is really inferior to the original doom . downgraded graphics, slower weapons, stupid little features nobody needs and small little changes that are completely unnecessary. it feels like it's a console port now. oh and if you're thinking of modding the game, forget it. the files are neatly locked away and all mod support has been dropped. even the newly added lost mission campaign wasn't that impressive and many places of the maps were taken straight from the original doom campaign, but altered slightly. if you want the real doom experience, buy a dvd copy somewhere, this one really is not worth it.",0
"as an educational game, it's reasonably good, but the execution of the actual game part is far from flawless. i've had multiple ui bugs where the ui got stuck. there were also long periods where i had no idea what i was supposed to do or where i had to go, and i can't finish the third level, because it won't let me pick up the objective anymore and this persists . as an educational tool, i can recommend the training mode. as a game, which it definitely feels like the most, i can't recommend it.",0
one of the best games i have placed since new vegas. millions of guns great people to play with whats not to love!,1
not recommended. the user interface is confusing. i spent over half an hour trying to choose to have a particular ship go to a particular planet and failed. i got stuck defining an ao for a ship and was uable to back out of that function.,0
love everything about this game. a must have for war buffs,1
"the graphics and sound are beautiful. the mechanics are almost nonexistent. as gameplay, it's a bust. it has a dark sense of humor and it has more to say than most games. the nonlogic of burning things to gain money is balanced by the metalogic of being paid for your real world time in fake currency. is it a skinner box or merely a long joke about skinner boxes? if it wastes your time, what's the difference? is every game, all art, a time waste? if you don't like jokes about words, you may not care much for this game. i don't know if there is much point in playing this more than once. you might want to look for it on sale.",1
game wont run 'invalid cd key' i am not jumping thru hoops and delete files each time so i can play.dont waste your money,0

"i never write reviews ever. this is the first one i write. to all gamers who used to like doom amp , quake amp , duke nukem, shadow warrior, blood and half life amp avoid this console product by any cost! this game has nothing to do with original doom. this is just an easy shooter where you go from room to room and kill several monsters not even sweating on the highest difficulty level. no map, no hidden keys, no famous mazes no smart traps.. just a corridor shooter with easy console oriented interface. i am returning the game in a minute from now.",0

"pretty unspired and overrated. puzzles are mostly straight forward, and you can just muddle your way through most of them. rarely got that nice 'puzzlegasm' you get on a good puzzle game when you are mid-puzzle and the penny drops and you realize your current approach is all wrong, and that there's a whole other aspect to the puzzle. a well designed puzzle has a journey - from confusion, experimenting, semi-understanding, more experiementing, full-understanding. there was hardly any of that. often i felt disappointed to solve a puzzle - i was overcome with a sense of 'oh, was that it?'. buggy in parts, you and blocks can stick to walls at times. never played the original. story wasn't particularly engaging. ending was horrible. spoiler either give me the choice to not enter the pod, or just let me plunge to my death in the incinerator for a nice dark ending. my heart sank when the cheesy cut scene with your wife and the president began.",0

"this game is amazing from experience so far. i wouldn't get this game for a child as it is very gorry. it has many gamemodes, and i was a lucky person when i got this game because it was free when i got it. playing with your friends is also a great game. the game is not easy, so if your expecting to win every game its not going to happen all of the time. i personally the game is enjoyable. the only reason you wouldn't get this game is because you have children in your house, or the game is too bloody for you. my rating . out of",1

nice to play first levels before u understand that it is grinding style game achievements too . sorry.,0
"definently not recommended. literally the only fun part is promod and movie making. the coding is sloppy, and you can easily mess something up which causes you to reinstall the game. punkbuster doesn't support their servers anymore, so to play on legit servers you actually have to find a working pb folder on the net, and download it. it's just extra work which shouldn't be there. the game is one of the easiest games to crack, and of all servers accepts cracked clients. bucks for this is just . if you're planning to play this game, crack it. there's no point in wasting your money when it's that easy to crack.",0

"slowest, most boring kids story ever with no gameplay or interaction necessary at all. like a visual kindergarten book. not at all like to the moon. an hour of just looking at the screen seeing nothing happening, having no influence on anything. just waiting, slowly, until you turn to dust from the boredom of the story. not heartwarming, just predictable. and if you play through it, remember it makes everything as a flashback in the end so you see it all twice! so dissappointed in the developers. embarassing to charge money for. i wanted to buy the sequel to to the moon but after this? forget about it.",0

"when it comes to cardgames, im more of a casual gamer and don't have the time nor interest to put hundreds of hours into the game, this might bias this review a bit. the few games i played online i could only fight with the cards i wrestled from the campaign and a few i bought. there is not much variety in the beginning because it gets costly very fast. being unable to craft a decent enough and consistent deck out of what i had, i was defeated every time when playing against other players. they were either very lucky or bought enough stuff to create something that is beyond what i could do. this is frustrating and annoying and thus, not something i enjoy. if you don't, too, than this is not the game for you.",0

"the game itself is ok at first, but then the missions get extremely repedative afterr awhile. if you are planning on playing with multiple characters with diffferent mentors, dont waste your time. the missions even in different places are all pretty much the same, and the combat system is immensly annoying press the right mouse key multiple times to shoot a long range weapon, or press the left mouse key muliple times to punch. the cutscenes are cool, that is the cutscenes that are in comics rather than the ones with the game's terrible graphics. the game is good in some areas like it's voice acting, but if youre looking for a groundbreakingly origional comic book mmog, look somewhere else.",0

"!!warning before you buy!! read all of this review!! this game is loaded with bugs that prevent you from enjoying it. example the biggest hiest, the pacific standard where you rob the union depository. you go in and once you reach the vault to grab the cash it bugs out and will not allow you to collect the money, thus preventing you from even finishing. this on top of, lack of players, lack of communication, and other various bugs ends up being several hours wasted. contacting customer support is near impossible, leaving forum posts is basically pointless. this bug has been around over months and still has not been fixed. there are at least - more that i know of. other things are players cheat and mod their games. basically if someone wanted to and mod, they can make you fall through the world dieing over and over until you restart the game. nothing gets done about this either. other than that, it is a great game love it, be warned though you will encounter these issues and trying to get support will fall on deaf ears.",0

"do yourself a favor and just get cave story. this game is too short and relies on a teleportation projectile for all the puzzles. which is fine, if it were of any decent length. it can't take itself very seriously. there are mixed pixel ratio issues in some areas. there's only minor enemies if you count the thwomp clones. it ramps up the challenge, but not enough to warrant someone's time or money.",0
"omg i luv dis game git it nooowwwwww i never really cared about minesweeper but however this brought a new light on the deduction puzzle game scheme. the little bits of rpg and combat elemtents are not overpowering and fit the game perfectly, along with a eerie soundtrack and good sounding noises. i could not ask for anything more in a relaxing brain teaser, pulling at all your strings in your head yet doing it casually. this perfectly blends the artstyle, qeusts, and overall gameplay into the best f p game i played in a long time. out of would die from teleportation again!",1

"very dissapointing. no solo play, and a number of losses in the gameplay department. i started it up and picked up my controller, only to find it was k amp m only. the shop in the tavern is now a cash shop as well, instead of an equipment shop. money grab, and a bad one at that. buyers remorse.. the only bright note? for me the discounts meant it only cost me instead of the full price tag to figure out this was a horrible mistake.",0
the core of the game is more or less the same as the previous game but with new additions. -transformations for all races except humans but they could use kaioken or potantiol unleashed -battle system got an improvement if you ask me -flying within the main lobby! in the beginning you can't fly yet but you get a vehicle to use. -and lots of other think i might forget. but overal it is a strong recommendation for those who played the previous game and are new to dragon ball games.,1

pure pay for win cancer. you can play this game for free if you want to grind all day in hoped to get the next add on to make your weapon worth a dam. this game follows the typical free to play pay to win model except the grind is painfull like if you had cavities and cancer of the balls. zero tactics in this game. sub par graphics. horrible movement for a fps. totally ficticious weapon damage. the sad thing is even if you pay to reduce the grind pains the pay off is . pleanty of other games to play that are much better.,0
"my first review. i bought this game times one for each member of my adult family, it was that good. i created accounts for my family members, it was that good. then i noticed, this game updates often if you do not buy the latest dlc you at a slight disadvantage, but hey you re a good player and the people without the skills can buy the upgrades, right? so what if single shot dlc arrow kill enemies and your weapon takes head shots right? hey they are on your team, this is forgivable but micro transactions is where i draw the line i can not recommend a game with micro transactions i have a rule, i do not buy games with micro transactions in them. they lied to me, and made me break this rule.",0
"this game opens up with a very promising action.. but as it continues, it becomes less and less action and more like a crime drama. it doesn't mean crime drama is bad, but sr certainly lost the distinct feature that made sr and sr a saints row game non-stop blazing action with non-sensical plot! it's the gangster version of spaghetti western. we don't get crazy stuff like gangs running motorbike into your headquarter anymore. the mission gets boring and repetitive pretty quick. it's disappointing since there's a lot of improvement in other aspects the guns are just fug-nuts, also the graphics! . but, personally, i play saints row for the crazy they got. i'd play gta for a more serious tone. so i guess sr is a big let down for me.",0
"this game is perfect for when you want to test your brain but also want to relax. it's a bit short, i beat it in hours when i reset every level after making one mistake. it's still a really sweet game though to just play in your free time when you don't feel like struggling too hard. the game itself is kind of like minesweeper but a more modern version. out of",1

"i will go along with the earlier reviewers. the game is fun, although there is no ranked multiplayer or something else. so you play against pros all the time or you don't find matches at all because everybody runs with mods. so it is soly a good singleplayer against ai or campaign against ai. and it is a good one there. and even it differs from other total war titles.. i like the changes. but the policy of the dlc's is unacceptable.. i won't pay , for gore, you could've made it cents or something because it is a feature which had to be already in the game. and i won't pay pay !! euro for a race d i bought rimworld for and already have more time in the game than in this one and it costed ! and again even if it is a good dlc , more for you.. everyone has to suck dry the warhammer license somehow.",0
best game ever. if you liked ac then this game will be x the fun.,1
needs so much work. i wouldnt buy it now. reflex is a way better game.,0
the stealth sections are horrible. they ruin the game,0
this is a great and very addicting game,1
"so laggy, this game sucks minutes and requested auto-refund",0
"i'm quite annoyed that i keep getting this game re-gifted to me by my friends. first, it was dino beatdown, which was totally ordinary and mod-like in presentation and not a good one at that , second i was gifted dino horde, and i wasn't even sure if it was a different game. finally, i was gifted this version, and while better than the other two, i'd hardly call a new engine a few more features a new game. it feels like there is always a new attempt at getting this game finished, it gets some updates, and then promptly disappears under a new title. would like to see some sort of 'finality' and i mean real finality, not just stop updating it or re-releasing it as something else . the concept is great, but the delivery is constantly flawed, which is a real shame.",0
"this is one of the best games ive ever played, and one of the most fast paced",1
"pretty good arcade shooter in general, but long exposure to such games makes l d really just another arcade shooter with limited gameplay due to very limited elements to the game. really need updates on bug fixes as well as new weapons maps etc",0
"controls are pretty terrible on the pc - couldn't get the controller to work which i thought was supported . it's got a really cheap feel to it, and the menus are a mess. seems like it should be really fun but very poor execution.",0
"out of - one of the best games i've played in a while, but there is a few things that left me looking for mods to fix them. main story makes you feel rushed to complete it, yet there is tons of distractions away from the main line which kinda leaves you torn between the two. i'd say after you get about half way the story it gets pretty addicting, and hard to quit. well worth it, and the dlc is just as good.",1
"i played both - amp - on my ps all the time leo games though most of the time are repeatative to get lego games have little to no flaws. controlls very simple. story it matches scenes from the movie almost perfectly without any dialogue! except for later games like lord of the rings which copied word for word frpom the movie frankly if there is any game that will stand the test of time its the lego games, no matter how old you get.",1
"this game wasn't too great, it sort of felt like a waste of my time and money.",0
"i don't understand why this game is st, it's probably because it's for geeks or cause it's a hack n' slash game l",0
"quack quack ! really good game with good dialogues , it gets harder as time goes , i think its because of the co op level design but i still enjoy it a lot , both story and online modes . worth my time and money .",1
"sadly purchasing baldur s gate enhanced edition, was a mistake. advertising presented by steam and valve, doesn t tell you whether the game you are purchasing will or will not run on windows . following the rules and guidelines supplied by valve, i cannot criticize the company .. containing free speech ..",0
"game of the year! d excellent rpg, lots of choices, that actually matter and change how things occur. a nice and mature storyline, lots of interesting characters and a hell of a lot of quests. diaolgue, lots of that, perhaps too much in some places. the various side quests are suprisingly interseting and whilst there are some dull ones, the vast majority are more intersting than main quests in other games. highly recommended.",1
"game is just garbage in general, strict support for dx , story line was just awful. and the multiplayer is just plain.",0
"i play pretty much every touhou games and completed lunatic difficulity so..i think i can say that- this game is bad, really bad. - little delay control, but noticeable. i always set v-sync to force off with every game so i think it's the games problem - most enemy start to attack you before they enter your screen - you can spawn in a wall - annoying menu system maybe this is just me lol",0
wow! this game takes all of the fun i used to love about the fps and adds some fun humor to the mix. interesting diffrent play styles and great maps. i reccommend this for anyone who likes an fps,1
"while i do enjoy the play and of course think it was long overdue that they 'officially' did the eastern front, i find myself not at all happy with certain aspects of the game. i find i vastly enjoyed the 'fan made' expansion of the original coh better. and being a historian find a great distaste at the anti-soviet russian propaganda used in this latest game.",0
terrible implementation of a voxel based system. it's like minecraft with a crappier interface. the limited inventory is the last straw. it's like space engineers but crappy. it's the same quality of level as star forge.,0
"amazing, have it for the xbox as well out of .",1
it's years since ww started and i have to say ubisoft did a great job on this game ! it's really nice that they show war from all sides .. and those facts really bring the horror of war to you ! i hope that ubisoft will make more games like this one in the future ! i'll rate this game out of ! goty,1

"trading, sabatoge, and recorece gathering. buy out and win. use the off world trade for super pofits. nice change of pace in a rts game. no vehile or troup combat involed huh. it gets less casual as you ramp up the difficulty. not a problem. pretty calm and relaxing if you time everything right.",1
"submitting refund request. game cant be played past the nd mission, like many other folks. using a high-end rig, so it's not integrated graphics causing the issue.",0

"are you a fan of dredd? you might enjoy this game. everyone else? go get deus ex, and ignore this. you don't have the nostalgia circuits necessary to enjoy this game.",0
"wow, just wow. this game is the literal deffinition of outragous video games. this game is one of the most fun co-op fps games i have ever played. the artstyle is fantastic, the voice acting is hilarious, and the story..the story is so good. the eneimes in the game are hilarious with even funnier boss fights. the only part this game starts to get serious is near the end, and still isn't even that serious. the best part about this game, is that they were even trying to take themselves seriously. this game is great.",1
does anyone know why my game would crash when i start a new city??,1
"wandering aimlessly the game. i have nothing against walking simulators, though i don't understand the point of playing them as an actual 'game', personally but some interaction would be beneficial. otherwise it's interactive 'artsy' art, which is all well and good, but not what i wanted out of the experience.",0
this sequel is simply ok. it didn't provide the same horror experience that the original f.e.a.r. did. original f.e.a.r. players will know more or less what to expect next.,0

"the game is pretty amazing, do you like 'the ship'? if so, this is a need to try. yes! it's in early development but if the dev's keep up what they are currently doing i have no problem waiting for the game to get even better. over an hour of games and i enjoy this game so much! notice a lot of people have ran into troubles. the developers are trying to fix the problems so if you have a problem with the game check the discussion page!",1
got this in the humble bundle so i don't regret it entirely but within mins i experienced two glitches that meant i had to restart from checkpoints. other than that the game is basically a long cutscene with gameplay elements strapped on to make you feel like your doing something. the most annoying thing as that crimescenes can be pretty easily figured out but some mockingly require for you to locate every peice of evidence no matter how completely useless. do not buy unless you like pressing 'x' when you're told to press 'x',0
"if a twin-stick, action rpg, in the setting of dead island, with the crafting system of dead rising sounds appealing to you, then will really enjoy this game.",1
can't stop playing!! it's good! very good! very very good!!,1
fun game if not a little confusing. could use more tutorials but beyond that it's great for a free to play.,1
"too hard. tried three matches on singlplayer, couldnt even get close to winning all three matctes. dont get me wrong, the matches lasted hours each and they were fun, but i could not win.",0
banned twice for doing nothing.,0
very good game heres some ideas for the game . reloading animations and sounds . a full map . more weps . cheaper weps. . individual cash and ammo . people can buy themselves except for barricades thats it!,1
"in short this game should've been a dlc for sr iv. it's short, and many of the powers and animations are just recycled from previous installations. it was fun in it's own twisted way, like the other saints row games, but personally i wouldn't recommend this. don't pay a full price for a - hour game, and wait for an opportunity on one of the sales if you must have this. guaranteed saints row humor hell is kinda cool place to explore - short in lenght - recycling previous powers animations - cannot customize character you play as gat or kinzie",0
"amazing third-person open world game. graphics are great, it runs well, there is tons of stuff to do, and it's very difficult to do it all, leaving lots of time to play! the grappling hook adds a very cool mechanic to the game. can't reccommend it enough!",1

i'd say this action platformer is good as the game for children. the rest may skip it without any regrets as it offers nothing of interest for an experienced gamer and a grown-up person.,0
this game need mmr reset every season so it gonna be less account buyer !! and also in-game,0
"why would you remove english localisation from my patch even though it was purchased from non-english speaking country? seriously, why?! also the witcher sense is downgraded for no reason. these improvements feel like a let-down. i would still play the game, i love it. i just don't understand why would you try to improve something that has been already working well.",1
"horrible game. as a new player they kick you out of games. if there is a group to play with, the missions last seconds. there always is a guy who shoots first guard in a stealth mission. horrible game, horrible community. with friends maynbe, but without playing friends its a useless game. dont buy, donate ur money to some children.",0

"i spent odd bucks buying this and all the dlc's coz i loved it on ps . but they haven't optomised the gameplay and physics properly for pc so it just drives spastically. slightest turn of the steering and you jack knife. and no its not me, as i said, i owned it on ps and it drove competely differently. i did really well. it operates like a completely different game on pc.",0

"old skool game originally developed by the bitmap brothers speedball , gods and z are also classics by these guys . it allows co-op locally and across steam. i suffered very bad lag on the one steam co-op game i tried. however, you can ally with an ai and the idea is just to survive and get a high score on this top down steam punk shooter. maybe wait for a sale if you are unsure or don't have the nostalgia factor like me.",1

"honest review. this is definitely one of the better games ubisoft has made with more or less smooth animation movement and interactive custcenes but the ssao setting is really getting on my nerves. all the setting for ssao is bad and the only way to deactivate it is via game settings under documents. other than that, the game is very fun singleplayer or co-op.",1

"when i first saw this i thought to myself 'this looks like the worst game i have ever seen in my entire life'. but then i noticed the price tag. i started twitching with excitment as i clicked on buy as fast as i could. now after many, many exhilarating minutes of playing this game i realized the full extent of effort that has been put in to making the conan the pig look, the way conan should be. the sound of this game is so realistic and with . stereo surround sound it really made it worth while. this game is honestly the most immersive game i have ever played. now, after all the time playing this. i have relized, that my first assumption when i first saw the game. is absolutly correct.",0
nice graphic but not my type of game.,0
this game should be deleted from steam..,0
the very first cutscene made me cry of how terrible it was.. i cried for the next hour i played and the crying didnt stop until i uninstalled the game,0
do you dream of being a truck driver and spend you life driving the motorways of europe? then this game is for you. if the idea of cruising round miles of featureless motorway is not for you then i would avoid this like the plague.,0

i'm going to start this by saying i love magic the gathering. the game is thoughtout really well and has some interesting different game modes. this is a great way for new players to get into magic or for players to start magic because it's free and easier than actually playing. the reason i don't reccomend it is because of the bugs. the game is way to glitchy and the game is unplayable for me. i have played it on another system and it worked better than this version but it still wasn't without it's bugs.,0
"nah, i ain't no freaking rich dentist.",0
"very poorly optimized. i had high hopes for this game, especially after how amazing the first dishonored was, but it runs exceptionally bady on pc. the game was virtually unplayable when it was first released for me, but amd released some driver updates, which changed it to tolerable. even still, there's random fps drops and the controls feel sluggish and laggy. bethesda might still manage to fix the game, and perhaps with a few patches to address the staggering pc issues, the game might actually be enjoyable, but as it is, i would not recommend the game - especially given i've been able to run most other pc launches this year on high without any issues. tl dr game runs terribly for pc and there's really no reason it should.",0

beautiful game. really worth buying.,1
"this game has the worst match making i have ever seen, a crazy amount of hackers and the general unbalanced nature of new characters makes this game extremely hard to recommend. the single player 'situations' are fun but short lived. honestly, save your time and money and go for something that ubisoft hasn't touched. update this game got worse, there are still plents of hackers, the color scheme is totally out of place they tried to make it look akin to overwatch and the 'peekers advantage' is still a thing. please do not waste your money on this garbage. oh and ranked is quite literally awful, unbalanced matchmaking, leavers, hackers, ragers and bad players. do yourself a favor, buy overwatch instead.",0
fifty thousand watts of power and it's pushing overload the beast is ready to devour all the metal they can hold,1
"probably the best puzzle-platformer that i've ever played. the ps has journey and pc has thomas was alone. it's an enjoyable platformer in which you control and freely switch between a group of different characters, who each have invidual traits that suit them to different tasks. the puzzles vary from the simple 'reach the end' type, to timed sections that often require one character to cary others and to even more creative puzzles that will challenge you to think laterally. but what makes this game the real gem that it is, is it's story-telling. the main story is told through narration that also tells individual characters thoughts at the time. there is also a 'meta-story' that is told through short pieces of text at the end of each chapter. all in all, an amazing game. well worth every penny, even if you only play it once. i've played through it twice so far and i expect that i'll play it again, the next time i want a good story told to me,mixed in with solid platforming.",1

"great concept, but i would not recommend because of networking issues. a friend and i started out with no knowledge of the game and died instantly a dozen times in a row, but that's part of the learning. it was satisfying to progress through and figure out the crafting, and eventually we got to level with some diamondite armor before quitting. but the online play seems to always run into connectivity issues somewhere along the way. one person would start dropping through the world and not be able to see any other characters, or they couldn't be revived, or items would de-sync and duplicate. if two players pressed a portal at the same time, we would skip a zone every single time. we had to agree on who would activate portals to avoid any issues. since this game has no saves and makes it very challenging to make any progress at all, the fact that the networking breaks constantly is a huge deal-breaker. i don't consider it worth playing at all unless they decide to fix those issues.",0

"this is a good fps with good mutiplayer. the single player game is fun, but short. the mutiplayer is hard and competitive. the reason why i never sunk very many hours into the mutiplayer is because the game has poor built in communications and most 'groups' and 'teams' are on irc, skype, or other talk items. so basically very few people actually talk in game.. another words i just felt like i was playing skirmish with bots because there is very little chatter and everyone is not having fun, but instead acting off at everyone else.",1

"i once loved this game. it has great gunplay and the stealth missions can be fun as hell. then overkill ruined everything. they didn't deliver on their promises to the commnity, they made it so the game is !! !! with all the dlc, put in microtransactions on top of that something they said repeatdly would never happpen . then the free weapon reblance patch did exactly the opposite and completly broke weapons, made most unuasable and the ones that weren't needed a butt ton modifications most of which are behind a paywall . at one point i loved this game, but, i can't reccomend it anymore. if you choose to buy the game only buy it on sale, don't even dare to buy it at face value your flushing money down the toilet. this game is the perfect example of how greed can ruin even the best things.",0
"this game is by no means bad or anything, but i also can't really recommend it. the control scheme -- as many other reviewers have mentioned -- is just simply too clunky for the game to be much fun. what i mean is, mostly, it's hard to really classify this as a platformer albeit a puzzle platformer, even because everything is always interrupted a thousand times by clunkily shooting arrows. as others have mentioned again , you have to click on the knight in order to change between shot types as well. for now i'm going to give this a 'no'.. but i really do think there's something good here as far as the concept and level design. if the controls were patched somehow i'd give the game another shot for sure.",0

"well i can say i do enjoy this game and it is very addictive, the game can be amazing and frustating. like all games with other people playing you will find some people have a good understanding of what to do and the others well you could slap them. the only reason why i wouldn't recommend basically it needs to be free to play. you buy the base game and dont get me wrong its good. it becomes a problem when it is getting dlc of little amounts sold for - and if you buy them all you would have spent a shed load for very little in return. if they do a season pass it would be well worth it. tldr game is good, dlc not worth it, needs season pass",0

this game is really fun in terms of gun mechanics and class variety. on top of that the game is f p but still has microtransactions. however these little in game items dont break the game since there is not op weapon mods or anything. it has a level crafting system that increases the perks on your character. my only issue with the game is the grind it takes to upgrade levels. because of all that stuff i give the game a . out of,1

"pros an interesting twist on the 'zombie horde' l d style game, the horde is far more dangerous when they are heavily armed police officers. great lan coop game unlock system for the most part is decent and doesn't feel overly slow neutral stealth is hard. not as bad as it was when it originally released, but stealth mode is not something you can really do until you've unlocked extremely necessary mods. bots are mediocre at best. mods alleviate the situation somewhat but 'going loud' on certain heists is pretty much impossible since they won't help with objectives or carry loot. cons -ludicrous amount of dlc. -overkill's approach to 'balance' is less sane than blizzard's -microtransactions! wtf despite the dlc and the eye-rollingly bad balance, i'd recommend this if not for the microtrans. those need to go final score out of",0

i have enjoyed this game. this one is a great game by herself. the story isn't too good but it works. the gameplay is very good in my opinion. it mixes platforms and combats in a way that let you enjoy without been repeated. in the bad way i don't like the combo-weapon system. i prefer a deeper system with more options. at last i need to say that when i was playing i thought the gameplay of this game is closer to prince of persia than to devil may cry. if you have open to a new way to see dante you will enjoy this game but if you approach it thinking in devil may cry you will be disappointed.,1
"i've played this game for roughly an hour now and i'm just disappointed. if you ever enter a gunfight with anyone on the first mission alone you'll be greated by lag that makes the fight impossible to win. the stealth mechanics don't feel right and the character doesn't even touch the ground which is just disapointing. in addiction one of the main features of the game hacking, is going to be immposible if your eyes can't spot five or six still letters or numbers arcoss a large grid. i don't feel this game is fun for any reason and honestly i recomend you get a different rpg or spy game.",0
"pretty bad game to be honest, i hoped it'd be abetter alternative to supreme commander considering the videos of planets and moon bases, but we only managed to play a few random maps with limited orbital bodies mainly because of the insanely unoptimised ram usage meaning any sort of decent size map means all players must have gbs of ram, the graphics seem worse than other games in the same genre yet use tonnes of graphics processing, and the cost.. jesus.. biggest cons- . only race . only tech tree . expensive in cost and performance my opinion is that if you enjoy an rts and think this game might be for you, consider that everyone who plays with you must have expensive hardware and you must then wonder where all those requirements come from, it's litrally just a few small rts maps wrapped around planets, no interplanetary combat, no insane space warships, no unique races, just different looking commanders you have to pay extra for from the in game store.",0
"i'm sorry to say that i tried several times to get this game working properly. it is so riddled with bugs it ruins any atmosphere. controls are awkward to the point of annoying. ironically the opening scene is a car crash, which not only could be a crude joke by the dev about the amount of times the game will crash, or a sublimal reference to that state of the game. it is free to play, and some people might not have had the bad experiences which i did. i feel there is something here though. the opening narrative cut scene is excellent, and gave me hope that the game was going to follow suit. i don't know if this is a work in progress. i could not review the story or plot due to the bugs and crashes. if these are sorted, then perhaps there maybe something worth playing. at the moment, though it's free, so i cannot really complain. still have to give it a down vote though.",0

"this game has nice music and looks good and the concept is really cool. you follow the music and go with the beat. it doesn't work out well. the best parts of the game are with the vehicle since the beat part of the game is actually working and the music is usually at full blast there. till then you usually have to solve really dull puzzles. imagine doing mirror puzzles from zelda, but you get those puzzles constantly. and when you're not in the vehicle part, the music is really really slow and just not there. you're expected to follow the beat, but the beatbuddy thing doesn't really follow it at all. if this game could be just vehicle stuff, i'd be able to recommend it. it would be good enough. but as it is, even .? i don't think so. it's too much dull work to get into the kind of good parts of the game.",0
"so far so good, in general. sure i had to tweak a few things mainly up it does seem to cache the environment which reduces the occasional hitches to a minimum after a while and there's that annoying 'you have an unredeemed item in the bagging area' message that won't be going away until i've done the hyperdrive tutorial, but other wise i'm quite satisfied with my purchase. fyi i k, gtx , gb ram, windows bit, game and os installed on an ssd in a multi hdd ssd system , audigy z , . maxxed out but with anistropic at and running bordeless fullscreen might be slightly better? but you can't tab . vysnc on fsaax fov out of txt high shad ultra gen high ref high hud on max fps no xml tweaking done as yet update runs a little less perfect at borderless dropping occasionally to just less than fps on the surface and to - when mving around in spaceand hitches more noticeable and tbh it doesn't gain anything from it visually on my monitor at least.",1

eu seadrift server is always offline,0
a good game to unwind to i've found after a stressful day. nothing has quite the same satisfaction of watching hours of gameplay culminate in you dropping nukes on your enemies to make you feel better. .. perhaps this is why the us dropped those two on japan.,1
"not been able to play more than a few minutes, due to no resolution options, and a stutter every seconds. do not buy this game, i'm going for a refund.",0
"i met the designers david and brooke back when i was in college.i have been waiting for this game to come out since the release of the trailer, and i can honestly say it is greater than i anticipated. the art style is so simplisticlly unique and the soundtrack itself deserves an award. it's not about getting through the game, it's about the narrative that guides you. well done brain amp brain. i'd love to see more of your work in the future.",1
"bear with me, i'm not entirely sure how to write a review on this there's very little to talk about eng i had been seeing this game running around as a little meme on twitter until one day someone gifted me it. needless to say, i was pleasantly surprised. from cute little visuals, to some absurd natures and scenes, it showed to be well worth the playthrough. pros - as stories come along, it's decently written and may give you a chuckle or two great grammar, and to my knowledge no mistakes in spelling short, but it's purpose is to be an introduction, so this certainly nails that on the head cons - -maybe a little too short? -aside from just clicking a bunch, don't expect much in ways of anything else than reading. it's a visual novel, and i've seen some people didn't notice this.",1
i walked in circles for minutes while being followed by a in floating png image out of would collect endless amount of random notes for no reason again. play something like outlast is you want jumpscares or something like fingerbones if you want pure terror.,0
"buggy as hell, units rarely go where they are told. units refuse to fire. there are better versions of this type of game out there.",0
tremendous heir of baldur's gate!,1
i've put alot of time and effort into this and it's very unfortunate that i can't read because if i did i'd be able to read the ing questlines,0
"the map shown when you first enter the game looks like about or so players are on, then you get in and there is player per each city. gg",0
a thrilling tale where you fight crime as the criminals. the true enemy here is money. money killed your family and stole your dog.,1
"well there's not much to say. the characters are there, i suppose, and serve as nice accessories to the minimal gameplay and are easily forgettable. so the 'game' is a glorified visual novel with minigames. the story is simple, the characters are boring, and the only character who interests me is the pig that's more of a hindrance than an asset and probably steals all your food resources. also, has anyone noticed the names? 'lukas' like george lucas, 'axel' like the kingdom hearts character.. this only serves to remind me of why i'm playing this game i'm passing the time until the games i really want come out. but it is entertaining, so if you need something to fill your free time with and don't want to be productive, go ahead and get the game.",1
"i did not want to believe the negative reviews. i thought everyone was just being too picky and spoiled. so i went ahead and made the purchase. mins . that's how long i decided to keep playing. this game isnt just bad - it is almost unplayable. i would consider buying it for . or less just to say that have the complete homm collection. i strongly recommend against buying this game. everything from graphics, gameplay, performance etc - all are out of or less. what a shame . .",0
this game is rilly fun and its worth the but there are some bugs and other things like its hard to find health but you get lots of lives that you can recover the money is black coins they could drop more and the useage of them are small but you get chest with good loot most of the time and so far the wost part is that i was fighting glob and he got me in the door way and i wasnt able to move whale getting killed i died but its a good game,1
"loved the game! some of the tasks were hard but you do overcome them once you master the game more and more. like how you mainly have to think of what your going to have to do in a mission, not like others tell you directly what to actually do. would honestly give this game a out of for the storyline being awsome, and the missions containing action!",1
easily comes into the list of top worst games ever made. do not recommend. avoid at all costs.,0
"honestly, i found the game boring and tedious. don't need to say more",0
"game takes forever to to do anything, and it feels like a naruto ripoff. glad i bought it cheap.",0
"thanks to uplay, you can't launch it at all",0
"wish i would have read the reviews and comments before i purchased. the tutorial level is fun, but after that it's not enjoyable. you have to wait days and days to revamp your army. one of the units does literally nothing honest i don't even think she can melee. there's a good amount of bugs too. save your money.",0
"no comments edit after waiting almost a year the game has improved a lot but it's still mediocre. on one hand the campaign is the best part since the ai has improved a lot since older tw games. on the other hand, with a pretty decent laptop, i spend hours in total just waiting after each turns. then when i get to play, i have to keep clicking and clicking and clicking to upgrade agent skills or declining all those ing requests for this and that. battles, which should be entertaining and thrilling, are instead disappointing and finished all too quick. reminds me mostly of bad sex. the enemy ai is pretty smart but every freakin' soldier apparently likes to jump head first into one big mushpit. big disappointment!",0
extremely fun until its not. only way to put it.,1
great concept but many flaws. lack of options such as key binding. no party system to play with friends in ranked. speaking of ranked don't bother. the system is hard even when it works properly which is about of the time. the other half is when it decides to take rank away when you were supposed to gain or people d c. and much much more bugs.,0
"best retro -bit openworld action adventure funny comedy game ever, u deserve this game , buy it to ride gorillas ,skate, travel with timemachine, kill cops with micropenis, jump on theyr head and lots of stuff .",1
"who the hell makes a poker game with no multiplayer? that said, i quite enjoyed poker night, even when i consistently got my handed to me by tycho. i admit, i passed it up at first, and only stuck with it as long as it took to unlock the tf items, but the time i spent with it was worthwhile. the real appeal of the game was the dialogue. there's great chemistry between the unlikely cast of characters. it's definately worth the low price of admission, and it might have even tought me texas hold'em well enough that i could play it for real. i'm not booking tickets to vegas just yet, though.",1
"with all the bugs and bm, this game can you off in its own special way. but, oh my, i cannot stop playing. highly suggest you buy this, and never use the perk saboteur. thank you.",1

"sure this game is a nostalgia trip but it's not as good as budokai. no local tournament mode, no cool combos..but it is dragon ball, and i do love dragon ball..but i also felt they kind of abandoned this game. if you don't know what budokai is and is looking for a budget game till xenoverse is cheap then this game might be for you. wouldn't recommend as this game doesn't feel comeplete. just get xenoverse , it's a little better than this game.",0
"to many bugs for me, lots of them have been around since the beginning and now there are new ones. stainless games is a horrible failure when it comes to this game.",0
"if you like rambo style and zombie killing, this will be the one you are looking for. yeah..that's it..kill kill kill and kill.. it's not really a good game but you will have some fun ingame. trust me, you will find some ridiculous things.. spoiler hand of god is pointing.. achievements are too easy to get.. good for time killing..guns upgrade and assist systems are coolest things in this game.. if you are hard-core gamers, this is the one of worst games ever you have found on earth. the bad thing here is it worths .. seriously?! i was really shocked when i found this game on steam store. oh my goat..",0
"updated review. lack of communication with players regarding issues patches, server crashes, etc game is horribly laggy online game balance is kinda ok, except that gief is unplayable game looks nice unlocking chars takes forever skins are overpriced as hell, and all upcoming skins are not to be bought with ingame cash but real cash. dollar dlc for stage and costumes game's netcode is pure garbage, gives you bar connections if you search for bars. lots of ragequitters ragequitting is not really penalized except if you are a moron if you love this series, go for it. but if you look for a fighting game, thats decent and not a work in progress cash grab, look somewhere else.",0
save yourself while you can.,0
"half decent shooter, but can easily be missed. overall gameplay is too simplistic, corridor shooter at its worst. couldn't get more linear as even previously explored areas get cut off for not reason. simplistic ai, which becomes a real weakness during hunter missions as alien or as predator . marine missions incredibly basic and kinda boring. weapons feel useless and clumsy. alien missions by far the best part of the game, rather fun. predator missions underdeveloped, especially as the available arsenal and abilities are very diverse. plasma caster gets little use, first due to lack of ammo, later on due to much better weapons. really dislike the inability to break actions like taunt kills or using objects. pointless storyline, with ending that makes everything seems futile. compared to avp from made by monolith, this is a definite loser.",0
"whatever fun there is to be had is constantly undermined pun not intended but appropriate but the incredibly frustrating, finnicky controls. the 'rewind' function present in the game is probably intended to be used when you make mistakes while you're trying to correctly dig your way round, but you'll find yourself using it just as often to take back unintended actions caused by the disconnect between your button presses and what your avatar actually does. perhaps a more patient player can stick with it but i'd prefer to spend my time mastering systems, not wrestling with input.",0
i want my time back. i really do. it wasn't entirely enjoyable. and i don't even have a lot of time compared to the thousands of others.,0
it's pretty garbage but can be amusing with friends. i wouldn't pay more than on this phone game. at least i'm not a foot fairy in real life.,0
i've heard good things so i picked this up and decided to give it a try only to have the video freeze with the audio still playing and once i finally got to play i started training onlyto have it freeze again. screw that.,0
it's a classic. that's all.,1
like d minecraft but with a story type thing minecraft story mode isnt from the makers of minecraft so i don't consider it a minecraft game only a rip off,1
wtf they at least could have added rockit bosters lol its a peace of crap,0
kinda oldy and slow from the beginning but when it starts it's gonna knock your breath out your lungs !,1
it's a fun and different puzzle with great graphics and a good story.,1
"i regret ever getting this game. too realistic. however, this game is very appealing visually, but not my cup of tea.",0
i have played lots a multiplayer fps games but this one is the only one that made me feel part of a team and made me feel important rather than being some mindless pyscopath shooting everything. this game is amazing and you should definatly get it.,1
"probably my first real mmo. made me realize that i don't like mmos. the quality just isn't there. when playing it, i had the feeling that it was some sort of cash-grab-free-to-play game and that there was nothing worth staying for. one day i just up and left everything with no regrets. it's a little shameful that i spent as much time as i did with this game. not recommended.",0
"great game. not that hard but need think sometimes. played on pc before, now on mac, very nice game.",1
"the latest update causes the game to crash in the middle of ranked duels when i activate my boonweaver giant. it also introduces vehicles which, apart from being completely broken inexplicably their activation cost caps at power, regardless of how powerful they are , cannot be played properly by the a.i. it keeps activating them all the time without reason, even on a chain one vehicle with the other , delaying every turn and, on occasion, leaving itself completely open to attack. solo play has become a joke. it's very difficult to win, even on 'easy', which means that the game now blatantly pushes you to buy booster packs.",0
"horse from the start till the end. here's what you can expect from the game. terrible filters overlay terrible camera work x opening doors cutscenes awful fov, seriously wtf running gives you motion sickness from the low fov and for the shaky camera shooting and cover system blows bot partner turn out to be useless. who knew! better than the first but still pretty awful",0
"amazing, the true successor to diablo ii.",1
"i recommend this, it's very spooky",1
"there is no way to describe this game, the emotions it makes you feel and choices you have to make would change your perspective on war. i will not spoil the story, you have to experience it yourself. this is a must have game, 'modern art'",1
"this is a really fun game. . fun? .. catch it on sale and its a must have ! i am enjoying the campaign , the other reviews are right it gets crazy hard and fast. not to many games i dumb it down to easy but i had to. the multiplayer is a ton of fun, i havent tried to find a random game but getting a few friends together is a good time. a risk style rts with a few different game modes. i like it.",1
"the figthing is reprtive, the ai sucks, and the controls are terrible.",0
absolutely hilarious! i found myself ignoring what i needed to do just to hear all the crazy stuff the characters say,1
i dont have much to say about terraria other than it is one of my favorite games and looking at the price you cant go wrong with it,1
i remember the times before the year olds came to the fanbase.,1
"extreme level of difficulty, make me sick on last level of this game. gaming in this crap is pointless",0
i guess this game like a combination two game,1
this game is the cure to aids,1
nice update that wrecked controller overlay software!,0
"another piece of art, just alike bioshock, but in fact, even more psychological and less concentrated on fighting. even though the combatsystem is well made.",1
i couldn't get into this game. a little too boring for me.,0
do not waste your time!!,0
"awesome game, especially the beginning.",1
"xenobloom does what it sets out to do well. the biggest criticism i have is that it doesn't feel as though it reaches the level of 'game.' it's more of a proof-of-concept for a ecosystem manager for a game, but by itself it's more of a simple simulator than anything. with what xenobloom offers, you get the notion that ibology set out to make the next terraria starbound with more complex flora behaviour, finished the flora behaviour code, and decided to publish that. ultimately, i think i'd get equal enjoyment out of having observational mode as a screensaver. i'd prefer to give this a neutral review if i could, but i'm required to either recommend the game or not in order to submit the review. due to feeling as though i've seen all it has to offer in the brief time i played it, i'd have to go with not. if you can spend more than an hour in things like universe sandbox, you may still enjoy xenobloom.",0
"in one sentences when u played matches u saw the full game. it gets boring fast, to fast. no charachter feels rly different. team is no communication, no difference to bots. i wish t had some more game modes, like in one that the hunters are the hunted. but the hunt, what feels more like a chase, gets boring after matches. no atmosphere just run,jump,run,jump--shoooot barrier x reapeat. i can think in minutes so many interesting game modes what woudl help the game be the best but seems like they cant, even after year, but hey u will get i bet in some months a new monster or a 'new' hunter. chasing chasing chasing. why not call the game 'the chase'",0
don't look at the dlc. buy this game. it's good.,1
"another great demo using cryengine, really shows the pontential of vr.",1
"this game is so awful compared to the console releases of mkx. wb games and netherrealm have dropped support for the pc version, please do not buy mkx on pc, this game is a mess on this platform.",0
really good game basically a robbery simulator,1
this is the best game this world has to offer..besides lol..and diverse snes-classics..and majesty,1
"cannot play because of uplay, really miss playing it.. thanks ubisoft.",0
"reviews need text. if you looking for more text, ratings, gameplay footage use google.",1
this game is a pice of they banned me for no reason,0
"solid game, cant wait for the next one.",1
"an absolutly pathetic port to the pc, the update is 'supposed' to fix the lagging issues but has made no difference what so ever. also while the game is good, it is not as good as you want it to be. a completly over hyped game, in my opinion get on consoles as the port to pc is garbage.",0
"not a poorly made game, i just don't like it. the comparisons to diablo ii are somewhat hilarious this game is nothing like d . action rpg, sure, but not even remotely close to d . if you like endless amounts of crap flying across the screen, with unreasonably large effects and heroes that blink across the map, then this game is for you.",0
"good game. interesting idea and quite unique gameplay, i do reccomend it.",1
this game was entertaining until it wasn't,0
"hey all! take it from someone who worked for s games and helped work on this game.. alot of the same issues that were there exactly one year ago to the date are still there. during my time there, there was a major focus on monetization and the priority of monetizing the game before they advertised it more and properly, because last year, barely anyone had heard of it.. and fixing bugs.. yes, they laid off the entire internal quality assurance department and focused on making money off a broken and unfinished game in lieu of finishing amp fixing regression issues.",0
"the witcher is an amazing game. i must admit i just bought it to get into the series before playing the second and third. but boy, this is a hidden gem. i hear people complain about the combat system a lot, and it is justified. the combat is at most decent, never great but a tier about . howeveer its not the combat that makes this game brilliant, its the story. i admit that i had to endure the first three hours of the withcer, but once i got caught up in the story i wanted to go on and on. it is based on a novel after all, so the game is rich in story and characters. if you want a fast paced medieval game, look somewhere else. if you want a rich story, deep lore and good world design, the witcher enhanced edition welcomes you with open arms. i rate this, out of bacon strips note my internet were down half the time i played it, so i would ad - hours extra to what is shown",1
i'd drag my testicles through glass shards on a desert with scorpions pouncing at it every second and after that for them to be rebuit and cut with scissors and burned than play this game,0
"love mech games,have played a few over the years, too bad it seems to be a dying genre, this one is third person and has lots of weapon mech customization. the story of the campaign is cheesy but cool.",1
"ya blew it update they originally ruined it by making the beta standard. thankfully they fixed it back to the original. beware that the beta might come back and it has clicking cooldown. yeah, they're that stupid as to put a cooldown on literally the only attack the player has in a clicker game.. clicking. review decent clicker game. fun to use macros. cute voices.",1
its half life but deathmatch,1
no shooting horses are in this game.,0
the same game as the original civ with a different skin. very dissapointed and as you can see on my game time it was not enough for me to keep playing.,0
"i have used dimmdrive for total war rome ii for the last months and it makes the game run more fluently on extreme settings, even when i record with fraps. secondly, i load windows moviemaker onto dimmdrive when i render my videos for youtube. these videofiles are normally in a range of - gb each and with dimmdrive it goes approximately faster than without it. i also have some small gains, when i save my videofiles before uploading.",1
"got this from the summer steam sale thinking i could finally co-op with some steam bros..do not buy! online is horrid not even there, as most the reviews on this state. i honestly want to play this even solo, but it stutters lags every few seconds, making it completely unplayable for me. if you have played metal slug games, you know what i mean. a damn shame really",0
"an improvement in just about every way, except for the pixelated style. i may grow to love it. new larger rooms and tons of new items critters make every playthrough a fresh experience. after hours, i'm changing my review. i ing hate this game. it makes me want to give up video games. the game is somehow programmed to give me exactly the items and collectibles i do not need. every. ing. time. i hate it. it's one of the most frustrating gaming experiences of my entire life, and i am pretty sure it's contributing to anxiety and depression issues.",0
a spreadsheet game about managing your own superman. mine is named john from accounting and he defeats bad edits of wresting sprites with his fire stapler and really hard punch attacks. if you like spreadsheets and also stupid things you will enjoy this game.,1
"i've been gushing over this game since i started playing it. it has a strong nostalgic feel to it i grew up watching ghostbusters . would say that they do connect back to the original film, and it's a little heavy handed in the beginning and sometimes, some scenes are a little too dark to see what's going on. i haven't finished the game yet, but now after about - hours of playing, the plot is starting to get interesting. the four main characters are here and their respective actors are doing their voices. they have managed to make the virtual ghostbusters to look like their live counterparts too, which is a great bonus. graphics are a litte bit dated, due to the games age, but it's still beautiful. it's fun that you're not playing as one of them, but as a rookie taking the role that zeddmore did in the group during the original film . well worth the cost, and hey it's a great nostalgic piece of game to play. experience the original crew and bust some ghosts!",1
i remember getting this game when i bought a reese's cereal box. oh the good ol' days.,1
"game itself is good, but the devs are terrible and the anti-cheat is even worse. false flagged after every single game forces me to verify cache after every game. games take forever to find and are often extremely laggy.",0
skyrim meets fable adult version high attention to fine details in a great storyline and gameplay. best game of ! rated out of highly recommended.,1
"i like the game because it's magic, it's online, and it's a lot cheaper than buying a -tonne of cards. also the graphics are acceptable and story mode is fun. however, i don't like the game for it's auto-continue function when you only have, for example, an instant in your hand or a clue to sacrifice. this flat out ignores a couple of possible strategies sometimes you just want to do stuff for the psychological factor, or play that instant at the end of your turn. please make it like it was in magic !! because i'm highly inclined to leave the game if this goes on. i sometimes lose because the game forwards to the next turn while i was still planning to play something. this is stupid and i'm very about it. treat it like tournament play!",0
i was a naked man flying around the simulation. out of would do again,1
good game to waste your time if you are bored.,1
"honestly, this game has provided me hours of fun. definetly one of my favorite games. there are endless amounts of things to do, and i highly recomend you try this game if you enjoy minecraft, and or are looking for something that has a much more in-depth game experience.",1
bigger than the dumps ryan takes. needs to ing load needs to be in english and not russian needs to actually work not like a game that some kid made in his basement minectratf and cs go ripoff p.s. ive never played this game before because i sit around all day with hr long jeopardy music waiting for the ing game to load ign out of,0
if you don't feel like reading this review this video pretty much sums up the game,0
"pretty damn fun open world fps that lets you approach most situations from a variety of angles. favorite gameplan stalk out post, find tiger in cage, use sniper rifle to free tiger, sit back and enjoy the show. story is entertaining enough and you get to get high on many occasions. some cool characters as well. messed with the mp for a few minutes, didn't care for it, but i really don't like any competitive fps mp anyway. tons of sidequest in the single player and lots of opportunity to just go and around. the driveing controls sucked, but they get by just barely and don't ruin too much. requires uplay, but, not once did it interfere with my game or get in the way. still would be nicer without though and some steam acheives. well worth you time.",1
"people in the reccommended section will talk about the patch that has been made for this game, and how it fixes many of the problems that the game has. given that so many people complain about the base game, i'm reviewing the patched version. its not great. the ui is clunky, its difficult to figure out what you need to do in the tutorial level to a certain degree. i lost a guy in a derelict spaceship cause one of the survivors stole his space suit. so sorry mod makers, i'm sure the mod fixes many of the game's problems, but if something is that bad to begin with, you're not gonna be able to fix it that easily.",0
"far worse than the first new xcom. a shame, really.",0
this game has that creepy and exiting atmosphere everyone wants! this game is great and i recommend it to everyone who isnt creeped out to quickly,1
"i was really looking forward playing this game and then disappointment. everything is so gray without vivid colours, tutorials are strange, story of game is nothing more superior. if the game is on big discount buy it,in any other case just save your money.",0
"no objectives, no story, no pressure. a relaxing exploration based game featuring beautiful pixel art, day to night cycles, and a dynamic soundtrack that changes with your surroundings. frogs, crabs, and owls alike all have unique sound and add atmospheric flair. it's totally not for everyone, but it's a nice experiment, a change of pace. like a computer-art piece brought to life.",1
"after playing it for a bit i initially enjoyed it quite a bit, with it's charming art style and ingenious gameplay mechanics mashed together into a brilliant puzzle game. but for me it is just too much like portal, i don't even want to play it anymore because portal is better portal i mean, not portal . too many similarities to keep me interested.",0
"this game is a lot of fun. the only downside i see is that the difficult curve ramps up serious a few missions in -- you need to have just the right strategy to survive. that said, the 'you never lose resources, even when your units are killed -- you can reallocate them at will' mechanics is frickin' brilliant. so simple, but so fun!",1
"my first impression was pretty low for this, but kept going and found by the end i was quite 'taken' with it.",1
"i really wish i still played this game. this is one of those addicting indies that can run on just about anything, and what with the game being updated regularly again, adds new things every few months. it is most fun when playing on a server with friends, but thats not to say you can't still do some pretty incredible things in single player",1
"this game should be an alpha. i'm a fan of wargaming but this game is just a waste of money - to unlock characters you have to pay dlc, no way to unlock in game. - campaign lasts hrs, after that you can uninstall the game. - storyline useless just kill explode everything. - you cannot skip those useless scenes between fights. - you can just walk and keep the mouse button pressed and you complete the game in normal mode. - no customization at all. - no drops of armors weapons. - maps are on binaries, you can't even pass a mountain because of invisible walls. - multiplayer is just useless, there is totally no reason to play with someone on this game. - no key bindings, play this way or don't. - no resolution costumization over full hd, if you have a k or a k monitor f you too! if you want to play a better gamelike just go for helldivers, or also a flash game 'sas zombie assault ' it's free.. this game could be a good game, but it is not. don't waste your money.",0
"i would not recommend this game unless heavily discounted. the writing and voice acting are poor, the combat is very poorly balanced and overall just very unpolished as a game.",0
its good if you like it. no its not,0
"this is all you need to know s payday official soundtrack - ode to greed s tl dr developer has reneged on promises for a long while, promised content, promised fixes. while at the same time adding more often broken dlc and most recently microtransactions with added stat bonusses. do not buy, this game is sinking.",0
sooooo hard that i requested a refund,0
it won't work for some reason on my xbox controller.. can someone help me please,0
"before you say anything about my playtime, i played this game a few hours before it was released on steam through desura. if you want to have a blast, enjoy the engaging music and fun gameplay then space farmers is really for you. it is a co-op game so invite a friend. as the developers said you pay for copies of the game. one for you and one for your most trusted or troll friend. you are in for a blast. jetpacks, cookie machines, dinossaurs, bulls, massive grinders trying to mince you into pieces, cows that if 'stimulated' will turn their bums into a incinerator.. and much much more. its been a while since i had so much fun. you can 'troll' and be 'trolled' not only by your friend..but also by the game. believe me when i say you that the game can 'troll' you on the most particular and awesome ways. what can i say? i love it and everytime i log in i am in a great gaming session.",1
"good music, cute characters, but bizzare repetitive unfair game mechanics make it impossible to get through unless you're a true classic gamer. which i am not.",0
its glitchy repetitive and the controls and gameplay are boring and dumb,0
this game is like my ex-girlfriend..it sucks,0
i need money re-relese - controls are broken both for keyboard and controler making it unplayable,0
"i really wanted to like this game. but as for many others the main sellingpoint was the gorgeous pixel art. the things that made me to not recommend this game was to much dialogue don t get me wrong, i love when the charaters is giving some personality, but not when i have to pause time after time to wait for the characters to say something none important stuffs when i am right in a good flow. the hit system. when the player is hit he usully hits the ground and looses so much flow in the gameplay that its just gets annoying.",0
"good, but they tease you a little in the survival guid when you unlock a scope but you have the rong person",1
"great game, epic story a must have. i recommend this game to everyone i know!",1
"great game, but the soundtrack is lacking.",0
what the hell happened this year? terrible starting decks and additional charge for cards ontop of the upfront game price? it's like they want the best of both worlds with micro from magic online and upfront game purchase of dotp. major step backwards and with hearthstone now on the scene they needed to be improving that much more.,0
last stand mode is really awesome,1
"great game with beautiful atmospheric graphics. the voice acting is way above par and the storyline is as good as any comic based game or movie can possibly offer. there's extra side challenges you can do to extend the length of the game such as collecting riddles or finding interviews of the inmates, but overall looks like the game shouldn't take much longer than hours to beat if you play it straight through. the animation is very smooth and fluid and the action makes you really feel like you're kicking some . some may find this a little too streamlined, but upgrade the difficulty level and you'll learn quick that you can have full control of the action rather than button mashing to win the fight. good mixture of stealth action, puzzles, and adventure. great game!",1
"it's wayyyy too short for the cost. this should be a . game. there are only around seven scenes. great idea, but not worth the cost. i was really disappointed.",0
"super awesome, a must buy",1

boring stale game modes. if one player on your team leaves you are pretty much done right there.,0
"i wish i could recommend this game but the fact that you are disembowling a cat repeatedly for no reason at all just annoys me. if they gave a reason other than the fact that they were rats i would probably be able to get over this. or at the very least, make the cat look more meanacing. the controls are ok but getting a little dated. there are plenty of levels and if you want, the game has a very easy setting which makes figuring it out less of a 'eurika!' moment, but more of a 'do what you are told' moment. if you have a kid under playing this game and you have a cat in the neighbourhood, don't be surprised if something bad happens to it.",0
"i didn't even last an hour with this game. i can see the appeal for some people, but i really wish i hadn't spent so much on it. pros - cyper layout is awesome - basic game concept cons - no proper tutorial? it took me forever to find the headquarters, and then even longer to find a bank to get a loan. - the controls are tedious if i had played the game for longer i would proberly have more to say. but i just can't force myself to open it again.",0
"i've given this game a lot of thought and playthough and decided that i cannot recommend this even though the gameplay is quite original and i like supporting indie devs. long story short unique take on an asteroid shooter - avoding asteroids without really shooting much, main mission is to collect orbs decent enough for a few hours of playthrough a day the rpg elements and the upgrade system are good, but may have been added only to increase playtime -clunky controls and only partial support -repetitive music, mediocre sound and somewhat poor voice acting -trailer makes a lot of bold claims like 'phenomenal graphics' which are simply not true -the gameplay is very rudimentary and gets boring fast -not that many missions available all in all, this would be worth getting for the trading cards and to maybe try something new, but don't expect to play this long term",0

"you know, i actually love issac, and the game is even super fun to watch, let alone play. the game deserves a lot of praise. if not for one issue. i can't play the darned thing. i can run the original on my computer, i know because i downloaded it off a friend's account to play the first one before buying this game. as it is right now the game seems to crash the instant i select a character and try to load up the first floor. everything loads fine up until then though, nothing else gives me any issues. it's frustrating because my computer does meet the minimum requirements on the page, so until a patch comes out to fix the crashing i can't recomend this game.",0
"looks good, but handles badly cons - no tutorials - no rebindable keys - video cutscenes looks dumb - boring story - ui isn't intuative, some buttons onscreen are barely visible",0

"complete rewrite of my review after years this game is honestly a masterpiece in my eyes. i could go into major detail, but there is so much more to it than first meets the eyes. it is incredibly well structured, and i cannot recommend it enough. your only problem may be the extreme difficulty at first but once you get the hang of things, you won't want to put this game down.",1

"the ai is bad and unbalanced. an enemy will see his teammate get shot right next to him but remain right next to him, or he will see a shot land right in front him but continue reloading out in the open, not even making an attempt to hide behind cover. they will also ignore the extremely obvious claymore mines that you can place, and will walk into trip wires even if they see you place them. at the same time, ai that do spot you somehow have pinpoint accuracy from meters away with a pistol or smg. additionally, sniping an enemy immediately alerts all the other enemies to your exact location. granted, the sniper rifles are not silent and the dead bodies are obvioius, but the ai should not be able to pinpoint my location from m away just from the sound of a sniper rifle being fired and shoot at me with pinpoint accuracy from that distance, even when i am behind a wall.",0
bought it for the cards.,0
the combat was smooth and i loved the visuals i have recommended it to several friends,1

"along with enemy within, it's hard to ask for more out of a small scale turn-based tactical game. make sure to get both of them, and be sure to at least play on classic mode. xcom is more about turn-based battle tactics than strategy, with the strategy element coming in the form of micromanaging your hq and all resources. but everything is logical, the battles are perfect and amazingly rewarding. ai is outstanding there is no synthetic difficulty to be found in this game. xcom enemy unknown is very easy to play due to the perfect ui and minimalist controls you can play entirely with the mouse , yet it is very challenging purely due to the tactics required to succeed at battles. furthermore, this game is extremely polished. so it is an all around incredible experience, highly recommended.",1

hell to the no. -asian does not approve! wish it was better,0
meh it's okay. i miss a lot of the features in and i wish there were more cards available even after unlocking everything.,0
good idea for a game but balance is horrible. like most table top games it has units that are over powering unless countered with the same type of units. trouble is unlike table top games this game has no concept of mass combat one unit fighting multipe units at once . there seems to be bonuses to units if you surround them but either they are way to small or don't actually work. the different factions are seriously unbalanced. wolves get double attacks and triple counters but still have etremely high health compared to other factions. holy factions get strong heals and improved accuracy. undead get debuffs that take three turns to power up and unit costs as high as the other so there is no way to offset their poor accuarcy by fielding more units than the enemy. all in all the game shows promise but balancing issues must be addressed before they even think of getting out of beta.,0
"game is massive, however it feels very generic.",0
"i really like this game, even when it needs some aditional development, it's really good.",1
this game is for boys,0
"the game is awesome. i played this game on it's free weekend and only took me minutes to decide to buy it. i love this game. in it's own way it has the medal of honor or call of duty feel but with swords, bows, axes, big hammers and alot more. this game is worth every penny. the hours that i have played this game so far was almost in one sitting it is that good. pick this up. trust me it is worth it.",1
only bad thing is it crashes when i go to play online,1
it's pretty short but pretty good. graphics are pretty and i felt pretty good buying this game on sale. worth.,1
it's the most innovative shooter i've seen in years!,1
"i really thought im gonna love this game, but turns out i dont. played about hrs singleplayer and the feel of the game is that of an mmorpg without the mmo. so what is left is a very clunky and unbelievable shooter. enemies respawn after a area got cleared which makes returning to said area for a quest a real chore. the weapons are, well too plentyful. i never got to really get attached to a gun because a replacement was just minutes away. the iron sights for the guns are aweful. the gunplay itself also feels lightweight, guns have no real heft to them. the design of the guns is also..well i dont like it. the cell shading is also not helping the game. all in all the quests are boring. story might be interesting but its hard to notice when hordes of noisy enemies drown out any sort of dialoge. people commend the humor of the game but for me personally there was in hrs not even one chuckle ..not one. humor is subjective so i wont judge it on that. but in all i was mostly bored with this game.",0
a good few hours of a relaxing minesweeper-sodoku hybrid.,1
took a little while to pick up for me but when it got started i couldnt stop playing and ended up greatly engrossed in the story and couldnt put it down.,1
". out of singleplayer seems decent even without michael ironside voicing sam fisher. multiplayer is a disaster -none existing balance ubisoft didn't adress any problems that community had cryed for -despite being on steam, it still runs on u-play, so forget about adding friends or reporting people -spyes with guns turn the whole stealth genre in to a siple call of duty especially with people that can shoot good -lack of communication, as even when you die and spectate from camers your allies, you can't type -servers always favorize putting high lvl players versus low lvl players -meangless customization as everyone uses most highest damage and best aim guns worst spend money ever. motton never trust ubisoft.",0
unbelievably fun in single player and co-op. the character selection and individual tech tree's make this a guaranteed replay!,1
"just nice game, fun days i spent on it, to none grind, just play like an action-adventure game",1
"this game is dying.. out of still broken, why? lemme tell you. the game is not optimised,op monsters and the same gameplay.",0
store was beyond amazing. that alone is enough to play this game. all the other aspects added in made this game a blast to play through. i love the extras and secrets to find and just had an overall blast playing this game.,1

its really cool game awsome,1
"stikbold is one of the funnest games i've played, i first played it a egx in with me and of my friends and we loved it! the game is so well designed and it looks amazing, the cpus are really well done. and the missions are really fun. when you win a match, its feels amazing!",1
"the game is more then expected. i been playing since rome and alexander. started out shaking with bugs, but didnt take them long fix it and give free content. awesome.",1
"at first, i was a bit disappointed that there is absolutely no design involved in the making of weapons. then, i realized that you don't get much weapon choice to create and later when you do, there is really no difference other than the new weapons you create have better stats.. there is no interaction with people that you sell your weapons to, you don't see them fight, they just buy your weapon and change levels uselessly . the game really feels like an unfinished mobile game.. i don't recommand.",0
purely kinetic visual novel. i'd love to say it has a great story but i can't. a good of it boils down to brief descriptions of some mountains paths in china with wikipedia hyperlinks. there is also some very barebones plot that is nothing more than a girl showing another girl around the area with a brief stop to get tea. it takes about minutes i'd guess if you're a slow reader to go from start to finish. there is also some very bad voice acting thrown in. it just sounds so bland and uninspired. on the plus side some of the artwork is nice but that's about all the praise i can give it unfortunately.,0
might be the worst and most frustrating metroidvania i've ever played in my whole life.,0
"out of pros semi-engaging story semi-climatic simplistic pixel..ish graphics cons - bad writing tries to be funny - very very naive 'moral dilemmas' actually, black and white - no controller support this game is not what is promised.. you might like it if you cry watching cheesy dramas about a lonely guy waking up, going shopping and talking to himself about how he lost his precious puppy. the very same level of excitement. regardless of what you do the story goes on with minor changes and is barely compelling. just like in the raiders of the lost ark, the main protagonist is entirely needless. 'would you play a game where you're not a hero?' -- from the game's intro.",0
this game to me is absurd although it may be because im playing with a mouse and keyboard its still ridiculous the auto aim is extremely bad and its hard to do levels later when the game decides to spam over healers that either keep healing themselves or other things and its almost impossible to hit the healers later as there over - big tanks that come after you that block every shot you throw at them to be honest its a good game but the over dose of healers and tanks are just a ridiculous combo that makes the game almost impossible to play in later stages,0
really enjoyed this game alot. cant wait to see the dlc if it ever gets added.,1
sucks that you have to buy for it to be any good,0
"i do not recommend this game because everyone i have talked to about it, have all named it pay to play. i am not going to lie in saying that, yes, this game is sickeningly pay to play. i finally unlocked recon, the sniper class, and the game wouldnt even let me get a scope until much later. not to mention that to do anything or get anywhere near what the pay to play players have, you must play this for hundreds of hours. most of the maps are severely broken and give one team an advantage that usually allows them to win. i would recommend playing any game but this.",0
great game but oddly enough i prefered alpha protocol.,1
pro jump scare con after the st pass it gets really boring. no cards chieves or real story overall out of i fell asleep and work up dead .. and i didn't care. grab it when it's off or free in a bundle . great game for the st hour then not so much.,0
too much like flatout . my thumbs down for an attempt to sell the same game twice.,0

"with the new expansion dlc just recently coming out, and the vanilla game itself both being amazing. i heavily recommend this game if you're fond of turn based strategies and base unit customisation. the new expansion dlc adds tons of new content and really makes the game a lot more fun. there are two elements in the current game build that annoy me there are a lot of visual bugs, but as they're visual, they don't really impact a lot of things, and the lack of being able to send multiple ships. you have more than six units, why shouldn't you be able to send them out on multiple missions, invoking more strategic play.",1
its a good game but i suck at bc i suck enjoy game when its on sale is too much for any game,1
"buyer beware! lack of support for local co-op. you must have two controllers in order to co-op, as their inept execution makes both the keyboard and controller act as player .",0
"starts off as a perfectly lovely story with strong female protagonists some of whom are coded as disabled and then it turns into a freaking horror story. was not able to handle the type of horror and had to stop playing. if it had continued being lovely, i'd recommend it. but this..wasn't what i was looking for.",0
"playing coop since there isn't any messing with the graphics settings waiting through cut-scenes reading upgrade descriptions reading lore text looking at the map jumping platforms climbing ledges looking for secrets shooting monsters wandering around empty areas and no, it doesn't add up to because there is no save game so be ready to repeat upon death.",0

not enough shakes too much fidget,0

this is the best tps game ive ever played,1
this game took over my life for a couplle months. i want them back.,1
"i gave this about two hours, enough time to justify saying 'i gave it a fair go.' it was fine. the aesthetic is a lot like borderlands, though borderlands feels much more like an alien wasteland that i get to actually explore. the enemies are a lot like enemies from borderlands, but in borderlands, there's a sort of satisfaction to be found in the way my attacks actually seem to injure my enemies. it was fine. the game ran, i shot some things, and it kept me diverted for about two hours, but it didn't have the depth of feeling i suppose i was hoping for. it felt like i was going through the motions of being a massively-armored space marine guy i never thought i'd really say i was 'going through the motions' about something like that.",0
"i just bought this game and so far i've put quite a few hours in to it and i'm only getting started really. this game is exactly what the city builder genre needed and it's the game i've been looking for, for a long time now. it's clever and brilliantly executed. the survival aspect of it works surprisingly well and doesn't take away from the game in any way. keep in mind, it is not easy. you will find yourself failing and things going wrong. so far i've gone through four different towns but it's still a lot of fun. i love it and would recommend it to anyone thinking of giving it a try.",1

"i thought this would be more enjoyable than the basically static fnaf games and spinoffs clones. i was way wrong, the scariest thing about this game is the loading times. pros - fairly good level and character designs - pretty good atmosphere - scripted jump scares can be enjoyable cons - long loading times well over a minute! - basic controls and set hiding places - awful voice acting and lines - strange frame rate makes it feel fps even though it is fps - many typos in text that are annoying - very little in the way of tutorials or explaining what you are doing i would say maybe fnaf fans could enjoy this but it's pretty sub par from what i experienced. gameplay on my channel youtube.com turbodude",0

"february update turned the game upside down. i've been playing off and on, doing a challenge here and there, but won't be returning anymore. it was fun while it lasted, and for new players that want something to pass the time until they find something they like, this is worth a try. gather some friends and figure out how to play. for a long-term game, however, there's really no end-game. you'll find yourself only logging in at the start of the hour to do challenges, or grinding dungeons.",0
first screen i saw when starting the game 'telltale games'. disappointment all over the place. i don't have good memories of telltale games. but.. this is an exception. i really enjoyed every bit of this game. nice puzzles and a great twist! will defenitely re-play this in the future!,1
i played act of war and it was an excilent game with a great single player campaign.. act of aggression being simular in almost every way i jumped on the chance to play. the company should be embaressed to release such garbage. single player campaign is one of a dollar game at the top of the reject ben at walmart. multiplayer is fun but gets old fast. not worth the money asked. i hate it when you purchase this crap then it comes out and your gut turns and you know youve been had. thats this game.,0
"after looking over the options, i decided i really didn't want to jump straight into one of the various combat game modes. i instead opted to create a singleplayer world to test the limits of building. once i had done so, i realized several things in succession. . worlds in this game are tiny. like, you have more room to run around on a tf map. you could easily make the entire world a single building, especially since the game is basically in minecraft creative mode by default and there are no hazards except for other players. . there are no singleplayer worlds. it's multiplayer, full stop. . most of the people who play this game are eight-year-old russian kids. . with microphones. . there's no way to mute the microphones. . i don't remember how this game got in my library. after that i went to stay with some relatives for a few days. i think i'm safe now.",0
great base game made much much better with mods love this game.,1
"it has a of a learning curve, which keeps a lot of people out. not me. i like a challenge.",1
"i had some trouble getting my controller to work at first, but after i figured out the problem it was smooth sailing. it's a very well optimized port, i get a constant frames per second at the highest settings possible at p with a i - k cpu and gtx card. it looks amazing, too, definitely some of the best graphics i've seen from a console port. as for the game itself, the main mission is pretty short, but there are a few more missions to do afterwards. the gameplay is amazing, by far the best in the series. overall if you're a big metal gear solid fan, this is an absolute must play game if you want even a taste of next year's phantom pain.",1
rocket league is a fun game to play with friends online as a team and get some goals or saves. cant wait for later updates updated review game is still fun to play and im getting better at the game step at a time. connections to the server is good at ms ping but sometimes goes over ms which makes it a little hard to play but still playable. i reccomend this to anyone who likes cars and soccer. its reccomened to use a controller but i use both keyboard and controller. its best to play with friends so you can have a better team that you can talk to using a mic. i will be recording this sometime to upload to youtube d in conclusion i give this game a thumbs up edit i have bought all the dlcs so far and they are all worth buying if you got spare money p.s if you found this review helpful give it a thumbs up so otthers can see this review p this is still an amazing game,1
"i completed the first version of this game in single player and not sure why they had to release the final version under a different steam id. this is your basic . d isometric view space blasting game with mild ship upgrades. although i haven't tried it, the game seems to focus more toward multiplayer. and there honestly really isn't anything that makes me want to try it.",0

"i love this game, it is amazing, fun, unexpectable, and it's easy to tell it's a fun puzzle game with a bunch of crazy stuff! i know a year old that likes watching me play through it! there's only one problem and i'm guessing it's on steam's side, whenever i go out of the game steam doesn't sync and it says i'm still playing it.",1
"optimization is complete garbage. i've waited days for a new patch and if the next one doesn't address the horrible frame rates, i will return this piece of garbage from where it came. my system is an i k, gb ram, gtx . i get barely over frames at p and it frequently drops down to - in multiplayer and the campaign, making the game unplayable. don't buy right now, wait until some patches come out or you will be off like me",0
"a bit pricey for that genre. wouldn t buy for that price again. but definitely if it was cheaper. after hours playtime still new stuff to discover. gameplay itself is a bit repetivive, but that s what this genre is about. runs really well on my system at about fps with a few slow downs when new stuff has to be loaded. but overall no problems playing. my system i k gb ram gtx nvme ssd over pci-e with resolution and antialiasing at ssaa x . no crashes so far. only problem i have after some time playing about - hours in one session, the game suddenly slows down dramatically. suddenly it only runs at a very low fps rate. i then have to manage to find a place to save and restart the game. happened now twice. when this happens, ram isn t nearly full. cpu usage then goes down a bit, but gpu usage stays about the same. hope this ll get fixed. also alt tab the game when in fullscreen is a no go since you can t get back into the game and it has to be force closed.",1

this game is fun even though there is only levels and it probably will take you about an hour to beat .i recommend you getting it on a sale for dollars . i think that dollars is to much money for to little gameplay,1

"was good, albeit a bit dlc heavy, until they ruined it with microtransactions.",0
"the game gets pretty boring when you play by yourself since it feels like you're just doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. however i'm recommending this game because of two reasons, if you're like me and you enjoyed playing the first one than this will be just as much fun to play. the most important thing for this game, the only reason i keep it installed on my computer is the online. lots more fun when you have a whole team of people..who work together..kicking . . out of",1
it is easily the best game i have ever played,1
"out of . this game is pretty much awesome. but you need to have friends to play with. and . . . and this is a big and . . . you need to get some sort of vpn app like evolve it's free to be able to play over the internet. otherwise, you're likely to experience issues connecting to someone hosting the game. when i first got this game, i only played it for like mins against bots then spent like an hour trying to figure out how to get a multiplayer game going with my friends. we eventually gave up and the game sat untouched for a year. then we discovered evolve and tried booster trooper with it. and it finally worked! it was like finding a key to a golden chest and inside was this awesome multiplayer game!",1
u must have this game because the story is connected to ac but there's no jackdaw gameplay,1
great game but prefer fallout,1
"all it took was for me to play round of evolve to know that it isn't worth . is it worth picking up? yea eventualy when it goes down to around . it's a fun game don't get me wrong, but it's overpriced. it's , i can pick up a aaa title from a couple years back for around on a sale and that's with the dlc. the new wolfenstein has been on a off sale times from what i've seen. this game selling at is insane. worth picking up later on when it gets cheaper.",0
a little bit too much boring reading than action.,0
i personally think this game was well made and names a few areas of depression. and i'd like to remind people that everyone experiences depression differently based on how their life is. in truth i think that the game would be better if there were more options. and as a side note this game is not meant to be something that helps people with depression. it only is meant to give people without depression an idea of how a person with depression has to cope with their problems in life.,1

"the escapists is a good game if you are really and by really i mean really dedicated to it at the begining it is fun but after following the same routines again and again, trust me , it gets really boring. i think it is a good game for smart people who are really into the game mostly i would give it a no",0
i am trying to like this game but i just find it a bit flat. i like shooters and especially the ones with modern military weapons. i enjoy customising with scopes etc so i will keep playing a bit longer to see if i can really get into it. to be fair i would probably be enjoying it more if i had a better internet connection. my adsl isnt really cutting it. for the time being i just don't find it immersive and i get bored after about minutes or so.,0

not a bad game. devs update it constantly whether it be with little updates to guns or abilities or big gameplay mechanics. be prepared to drop money on it however.,1
"for now do not get this game, the settings is a joke, the beta had less bugs then the release, i ran witcher on ultra settings with smooth - fps, here im in fps gg, the bugs are endless, from not being able to drag bodies, to not being able to do simple actions, stay away from this game till they patch it, im a hitman fanboy but damn no way to deny the bugs and the long waited slide show epic game , every one knows this you would have to live on the moon not to know this . but like many other reviews on steam the company practice is also a part of the game experiance. and people are quite happy to down vote games because of there buisness practice and this is no different . like for instance main mission to play until they release the next episode which i persume is going to be also big mission with small ones, the only way to avoid the waiting is by doing the challenges, but still shame i need to run game in p to have a smooth fps",0
"i can't wax lyrical about this game like i have other indie games, i mean the gameplay is kind of slow, i doubt there is too much replay ability. yet despite this i would class this 'fall out esque' game a ill steam gem, something which is undoubtable overlooked in favour of other games, yet still deserves the attention it can get. positives interesting story, nice graphics decent text, none of that cheesy poor grammar 'stuff' which can plague other indie games. awesome map, the way the character traverses the world and all the instances are pretty well managed. con combat is repetitive, not really a way to change that, but then it does make the other gameplay more enjoyable. character walks slowly, however this is merely a petty comment which is also redundant as you can change character speed.. conclusion well worth a buy, if it s in the sale, definitely get it, if not.. then unless you want to write a positive review hold your horses and think before you buy.. but as long as you think you do want to buy it. it s pretty damn fun! edit spelling mistakes",1

"you are a totalwar for more than decade ?, you waiting for every totalwar games when it annouced ? . you love a tactical , complex combat ?. if you say yes to all of the thing i say above then avoid this game for your own good. the campaign, and battle ai is a big mess ton of bug, glitch..etc a lot of feature of totalwar series had been simplify , or complete remove like agent movie, a long detail cinematic general speech, family tree..etc the battle is over too fast. there is no chance as well as no need to do tactical maneuver, everything over in just about. minute and out of of it is the time both side marching to each other",0
maybe if it wasn't for the hacking and the eyes of your player coming out of your chest this would be more fun. it's the best mix of tactical and casual shooter i've seen. if ubisoft fixes the issues with the game i'll recommend it.,0
out of love the game,1
its funny how this game uses arrow keys. the arrow keys on my keyboard are busted but i don't really mind because almost none of the games i play use arrow or have an easy key configuration. you cant configure the keyboard when you first create your character so i actaully turned used on-screen keyboard and starting play elsword with the on-screen keyboard haha. but it doesn't matter after that because after i change from arrow keys to numpad the keybindings would just reset a while. the game was really confusing at first. i had no idea what i was doing. i feel like a dumbs . i'd give it a out of . c .,0
"beautiful remake of the very first tomb raider, the level design is nothing short of brilliant, the puzzles will keep your brain gearing on and the action is fun. some times there are problems with lara clanging on to ledges and stuff, and some tight-space combat situations, but other than that it's ace!",1

"i mean come on, no single player campaign in a r title. this game is fun for a few hours, then the lack of content and things to do set in. if they add a campaign as a free dlc then my mind may change. until then, poor job. i was waiting for this game to release and then it finally came out as a let down.",0

"even better than the last farm sim. physics have been 'improved' to be more realisitc, which removes some of the multiplayer tractor vs tractor fun, but all for good reason. new maps plus forestry add a lot. easy modding is great for this game, and lots of data stored in xml files makes it super easy. very fun!!",1

"it really doesn't matter how great the graphics, gameplay or gamemodes are, it is all absolutely meaningless with fov restriction. apparently warface's devs made a stand on this and won't add fov options - pretty much condeming the game to never become popular thus not getting competitive players which laughably defeats the original purpose of locking fov in attmpt to make the game competetive. yet quick check of the proven competetive games like shows they all support custom fov, doh! fov option is the only announcement i wait for this game",0

"the game is like the standard x game, build ships, research tech, colonize worlds, however the ships you can control in a fleet is limited to tech, and the combat is broken down to three turns per side. missiles, lasers, and balistics. thats it.. the game is pretty boring after the first few hours of play, you can't use tactics in combat, and you can't have massive fleets like in most ofther x games. i stopped playing this game after a few days of play, hoping it would get better. it doesn't",0

beautifully made and worth the feel trip.,1

it's fairly fun but i feel like assualt rifle's dont do enough damage as they are outclassed by the smg's nearly everyway i say they need a damage buff and samething if bushwhackers turret i understand it's for defense and ambush but it doesnt do nearly enough damage and being way to easy to flank and kill i really only think they should do more damage to make running past them actually dangerous currently they are about as deadly as a pistol on a stand which would probably be more effective but besisdes that rant it's quiet good for being fast paced and the abilities kinda reflect that with the health and ammo pack abilities for the people and some of the parkour manuevers can help you get around with the wall jumps and do some cool stunts but i would say game is out of velociraptors,1
be sure you dont buy the watcher pack it is absolutely usless and a waste of money,0

"lococycle is an extremely timing-focused button-mashy experience. what challenge there is comes from avoiding obstacles and reacting to qtes. the story seems to be trying really hard to be funny, but it never made me laugh so much as groan or wish i was playing something else. i put hours into this game because it required no real effort and i was curious were it would go. unfortunitely, the late game starts to require some effort, and i'm really not invested enough to care. game over.",0

"the game has alot of potential but they ruined it in the last update at least for me, the quarry was ok the way it was, but they ruined in with prospecting. basicly to get stone you need to press prospect and it will take minuts i think to scan around for a dig site, once found you need to press dig, and idk how long it takes but if you dont want to dig in that spot because you know it is next to water and will flood your buildings you need to clear that dig site, that takes hours! and you cannot prospect annother site until it is cleared. and if you do want to dig in that site and the terrain around it is to high you cant dig and have to clear it and prospect agin. just dumb. unless you have gold but no one spends money on a game that forces them to spend money, they spend money on a game they enjoy free first. total war dosent get this atm so i will uninstal",0

"although i am against console-to-pc port, this game has been done right. alan wake is reminiscent of silent hill and max payne and combines these two styles excellently. the story is very likeable and haunting. the characters, voice acting, script, dialogue and plot are great. the developers 'remedy' have put love into this game and you see it.",1
"buggy as hell, only fun with friends. bugs include floating and falling out of world if you fall out of the map there is no kill zone getting stuck in trees and rocks when useing a block jump a barrier but the killer hits u from the otherside cases of menu being buged volume setting took my mouse and was changing my setting while in game and more that i haven't seen in my few hours very repative gameplay.. overall not really worth it",0

"no mod seems to be able to fix this title nor make it fun enough to play. i used to be drawn to the battles in rome med shogun but not here for some reason. i think the fact so many of them are broken city sieges rather then open field encounters and when the armies do 'sally out' to meet you in the field, both armies have to search for each other like no scouting nor intel could give either army good enough report to lock down thier locations on a limited battlefield perameter ? i have a lot of hours in this game and tell you the truth i never make it much past turn before i start to poke myself with a sharp stick i am that bored. and this is after over hours played. listen to most here and move on. this is not the game you are looking for and after this title i would very closely examine any other title this company puts out without a total acknowledgement that they messed this title up badly.",0
"i wouldn't recommend buying this game for the full price as it is almost impossible to get good value out of it. while the game is mechanically fine i feel like it has no challenge even at the highest difficutly setting, and therefore there is very little replayability to begin with.",0
the scariest part are the floppy physics,1
"there's not a lot of good things i can say about this game, i was looking forward to playing it as i love retro games, and i just feel majorly dissapointed. i find the game incredibly hard to grasp, i am not sure what my heroes are supposed to do and i keep getting lost in the very samey looking town. good soundtrack is nice option to let the computer handle the fights for you. bad - there are no tooltips for the options in the game, so you have to resort to the manual. - alt tab to check manual makes the playwindow so tiny you can barely see anything. - the game lags horribly after just - minutes of gameplay. the music skips and overall the whole computer seems to lag from the game. - first time playing you can't skip the intro story.",0
"my opinion on magical diary is mixed. on the one hand i had fun on my first playthrough. i wanted to see where the story was going. the rpg aspect skills to grow mainly seemed interesting. on the other hand after having finished the game twice, it seems that no matter what skills you choose to improve or how bad you do at the several exams , you can always finish the game, and it doesn t change the story much. replayability is compromised by having to re-read everything or almost everything, or risking missing some new original developments in the story when you ve taken different decisions in the past. if you enable to option to fast-forward then the game will not stop on new text that you haven t read in your previous playthrough. still it was a nice experience the first time, so if you re not afraid of reading relationships magic stuff the game, in retrospect, is more a visual novel than an rpg and can get it on sale for cheap, then you could do worse than trying it.",1
"the concept of this game is brilliant. unfortunately, the same can't be said about the execution. sound design, quality, physics, enemies - just about anything that makes or breaks a game, you can bet your bottom dollar that this game messed it up! half the time, all of the blocks in the world are entirely transparent! in fact, this game is so bad that it's not even worth going through all the problems with it, please, for your own sake - stay well away from this game. this game is the definition of a bad minecraft clone. seriously, steer clear of this game.",0

"wasn't expecting to love this half as much as i did. strangely compelling gameplay led to me completing the whole story well of the endings in around hours and one sitting. there's a very human aspect to the game, challenging you to protect both your morales and your 'family' in a non-ideal setting. gameplay is surprisngly hectic and you can feel a real jump in your efficiency as the game goes on. overall a thoroughly good play and well worth the price of entry. i doubt you'll find anything of a similar ilk anytime soon",1
"i'm downvoting this because i was on the expectation that i could play with my friends who have ps while i'm on pc. it can't happen!! you can only play with your friends a private match with bots and no voice chat! as announced by the advertising 'competitive cross-platform gameplay with playstation users' can't play with my friends, so thats a no!",0
i bought this game on the steam sale and thought i'd give it a try although it was kind of short . to my surprise it was really a good game and story and imho opionion would have been worth it at full price. if bought on sale you can't go wrong with this game.,1

"doesn't bring much new to the table, but takes various old horror tropes put together and smashed into parkour chase sequences. slightly dated puzzle mechanics finding keys, fuses, valves etc. dressed up in an admittedly excellent horror setting. don't expect it to take you much more than four hours to complete, but that's about right for a game of this genre and style.",1

"if you want a game where people spam loads and a community then this is the game for you. this game has gone downhill from the beginning. when the game started with russians and wehmacht the game was fun to play, infact i had hours playing time, when they added americans and okw to the game it was decent until they nurfed the crap out of the germans and made wolverines and jacksons op and yet a king tiger can be killed in shots hahahaha, then they add britain which fair enough i thought this looks like it will be cool as f ck! until i played against them and yet again they're stupidly op, get a balance going on this game cause coh seems to love making allies stupidly overpowered to the point where you pretty much lose the game minutes into playing it. after playing the game since release i can well and truly say - don't bother buying this game -",0
"the term 'physics puzzler' can only loosely be applied to this game. it's little more than a flash game with some first-attempt d models attatched. there were several puzzles where it took or restarts without changing any of the items in the puzzle for the physics to work properly. all in all, the game is not fun, your only rewards being high-scores without leaderboards , and watching the same cat death animations over and over. the money you spend on this would be better served buying a cup of coffee. out of",0
"this game was a very good game up till now. instead of a great pc game made for it now he have lost close to songs, p resolution and we've got port of a mobile port of this excuse of a game. rockstar is going down, also pulling their games down with them. i used to think that rockstar is a good developer, i've bought most of their games including gta v on ps but what they pulled now makes all the previous actions not important. important thing is we've had a good pc game, now they switched it for a stinky smelly piece of crap. congratulations rockstar, good luck selling a version of a game worse than pirated copy downloaded from the p p torrent . not many studios can destroy already good game like you do! better look for a box copy of the game to experience the only true feeling of san andreas pc i recommend this version . digital downloads can easly change the game and rip us off.",0
"this game is easy to pick up and is great for its time, it gives you alot of freedom that isnt found in many pirate games today it does not take it self very seriously but it has unique charm wether your dancing, plundering, helping or destroying the games factions. my only real complaint with the game is the land battles when plundering a town they feel poorly designed and tacked on, however overall its a fun expiriance worth giving a go out of would dance with sid meiers again !",1

"i bought this game with a discount for cents, wanted to play something inbetween my main games. i do not recommend this game. the controls are laggy as f!! and you will repeatedly die from long level progression with no checkpoints in the game. finally get to a crucial point even in the tutorial, and i die unsure about what i need to do. they throw too much at you with zero tolerance for failure. i've literally never raged so hard in my life at a video game and even when i'm only on lvl in the tutorial, i chose to uninstall. it's terrible!!",0
i wish the dlc would be cheaper.. i wish..,0
"this game.. i have many mixed feelings. it undeniably looks artistically stylistically good, and sounds great. and the gameplay mechanic is used well. to my pleasant surprise, many puzzles required some inventiveness. as a game, it's actually good. the story.. well it's just not my thing. it's chock full of symbolism, which i can see many people regarding the game as deep, but i felt no attachment to the main character. if there was no story at all, my tune may be different. i honestly don't know. but i think my main gripe which is a lame gripe is that i feel it's overrated. this game has been praised like crazy, out of , etc. it deserves a good rating all right, but i will give it a at best. maybe an . from me.",1

"i play games with a controller on my tv, almost exclusively. with that setup, heavy bullets made me motion sick. that never happens to me. i think it's caused by the combination of poorly calibrated controller controls the acceleration curve is very poorly mapped to the left analog stick, and aiming with the right stick feels completely off , the very wide fov, and the extremely fast maximum running speed. i love the idea, and i love the style and music, but heavy bullets is, for me, unplayable. if you play games with a mouse and keyboard on a monitor rather than a tv, your experience will probably be different from mine, but i cannot recommend heavy bullets in its current form with my setup. this is my first negative steam review and it makes me very sad to post it, but i'd prefer to be honest.",0
"the protagonist is exceptionally flat and boring, relying on special snowflake backstory and aesthetics to seem cool. combat is rps where every enemy keeps throwing rock tacked on to a rythm game. the best worldbuilding can't save a game if if focuses on a boring protagonist and lazy gameplay that eat up of the gametime. i finally tried this game after hearing so much hype for it and i honestly can't understand why. were the other games so much better that this one got praise retroactively? or are people just willing to overlook poor mechanics and characters for the sake of pixel tiddies? at least, that's my opinion. not like anyone's going to read the reviews for an eight-year-old game.",0

"loved it, then it got boring. hackers, left me to play solo in private matches, which is fun for a while. nobody really interacts with eachother. honestly, this game is already slowly dying, it gets repetetive, and doesn't have much of a charm. single player is beautiful, with wildlife and more dense area's and whatnot. multiplayer is just same old bland thing again. buy it when it's on sale if you really want it that bad.",0

"the approval is well earned. thick with ambience and immersion this game of assasination and sneaking is really defined by your choices. if you avoid killing enemies or slaughter them wholesale it affects the world around you, and each choice to let a target live or die impacts the rest of the game. each playthrough is different in that the choices you make define the game.",1

"do.. not.. buy.. even at off.. you will never see those dollars again this game had been hyped as a tactical fps that was supposed to satisfy the rainbow six itch that many of us have been feeling lately. the problem? this game is worse in every conceivable way to even rainbow six raven shield which was released a full decade ago. seriously, just bust out raven shield or vegas again with your friends instead of buying this. the graphics, gun selection, hit detection, enemy ai, friendly ai, sound effects, menus, functionality crashes bugs , and generally just the playability of this game is all awful. the only thing that was up to snuff was decent map design.. but that doesn't help much when every single aspect of the game going on inside those maps is terrible.",0

"men of war assault squad although quite fun and challenging is an unfurbished experience. first of all, i'll start with my main gripe with this game, which is the terrible a.i. my soldiers would make the dumbest ing mistakes regularly, they would stop running to cover to shoot at a tank thus getting blown up , randomly drop to the ground in danger making them get killed , not fire from buildings when the target is clear from the window making them get shot and killed and they would always stop at a certain distance from the spawn once they enter the fray letting their comrades in the front get killed . the only thing that i like in this game is the immense scale. unlike the other rts ww game i have in my library something company? this lacks any sort of unit cap, letting you control hundreds of units at once. in short, this game is a flawed mess. buyer beware.",0
can't play it in widescreen. really struggling to even find a solution to fix it.,0
"my rating out of replayability yes achievements multiplayer no what is this game about? this is a base jumping simulator where players earn points for performing tricks across eighty unique levels. there are seven achievements with their own varying difficulty to attain. the only involvement with other players is the leaderboard. storyline is told through in the level selection by the stoner radio host. in the level selection there are options you can choose that either tell you facts or show acid-trip cinematics with odd stories. is it fun? yes, the game will keep you busy for hours, but doing the same tricks on various layouts of levels will get old.",1

its bad waste of time,0
"the graphics are good and the gameplay can be fun, but when the dialog is swearing just about every other word, the story is extremely predictable and the ending is just wtf. the fact that it uses games for windows also doesn't help this game out at all either. the skillshot mechanic of killing the enemies can be fun which is used to buy upgrades and ammo for your weapons, but when you are given so many points to buy every thing to the maximum right as it unlocks then what is the point of making you buy the upgrades instead of just giving them to the player.",0

"really boring and far behind other games like imperium. the beggining is really boring, and when i could finally get into the mechanics of the game, i realised that it was worse than many games of this kind. i personally don't like it. i guess it is because i have played some games like this one before, and i guess this is below what i expected.",0
"playing this game makes me think of dante's inferno the poem, not that crappy gow video game . it jokes around the idea of a hell on earth with a cocky hero cracking jokes, while invoking imagery of demonized day-to-day activities such as watching the news, drinking soda and working at a corporate monstrosity. if you're a fan of the original, then the combat is still here, but dante is more crass than you remember him. a quality which i think makes him more believable as a comic personality, like deadpool meets spiderman. i can only hope that this re-imagining of the series garners enough of a fan-base to warrant a sequel, as seeing the actual devil may cry business starting up would be a delight for me.",1
actually quite fun. if you grew up in the ol' nes world and love the music and graphics of your youth in the s then this game is a sandbox full of warm goodness. fun stuff if you've got a moment. i give it high marks.,1
"running on modern hardware, this game is borderline unplayable. i know that it's a landmark in gaming or whatever, but i only managed to play for a few hours before giving up altogether. if you get it in a bundle, you could install it to marvel at how far we've come particularly regarding driving physics , but that's about it.",0

if you liked kotor you will love this game.,1
it was a very pretty cod. graphically it was nice to look at but it felt poorly optimized. even with the game on an ssd the missions loaded very slowly. did the devs use psd files instead of jpgs? there were glitches that prevented me from completing the mission. restarting the mission and trying again fixed it. ai would block other ai. there was this glitch that prevented a mission from advancing forward because i had the game installed on an external usb device. this has been the only game i have heard of that required faster the usb speeds to load game files. the story was also not really enjoyable. the space and underwater fighting was cool.,0
best game ive ever played,1
i find it impossible to improve at this game in any way.,0
"although it is very similar with ets , ats has several improvements such as having more detailed city and scenery. also it has added alternative cargo parking locations allowing players to increase difficulty. the game is usd only, so dont expect many content at launch. the map is quite small for now. free trucks will be provided soon and more map dlc will be free. i am recommending this game only if you clearly expect to get not much content. and now american truck simulator multiplayer mod is here !! it is much more better than etsmp since the map is smaller and you meet other truckers more often",1

this game is hard to learn if you have no one to teach you and youtube doesnt seem to help at all. im sure this game would be fun if someone taught me.,0
"i wanted to like this game, it looks great and has the souls feel that i love. the combat is just sluggish and feels very unpolished. i also have gotten through a few bosses now and they just are not fun. boss fights and combat being the staple of this game, i can not recommend this game with both being so lackluster.",0
its rare to find a game that can keep me fully entertained for so many hours. give it a try your wont regret it.,1
"i cannot recommend this game because of its high learning curve and large amounts of random gameplay elements. the high learning curve is not a matter of difficulty it is a matter of inadequate documentation. when starting this game, you are given very little information about the actual gameplay. the 'tutorial' assumes you already know how character movement is accomplished, what the icons on your screen mean, and what gameplay jargon means. for example, the game continues to warn you about 'courage' but never tells you which of the meters bars counts on the overly complicated ui represents courage. the other major problem with this game is the amount of guessing required. in minesweeper, you have enough clues to figure out the location of the mines. this is like minesweeper in a tunnel with two different types of mines and no way to mark any of the mines.",0
very frustrating repetitive game with throw away gameplay but with good storyline and soundtrack if you can make it through. this game is also ridiculously hard at times when you will run out of ammo and have about enemies chasing and throwing stuff at you and have to seemingly run to the next checkpoint to stay safe on normal difficulty. overall good but repetitive game with interesting characters. i recommend this to movie lovers because of the half game half movie style. hopefully american nightmare will be good.,1
wtf? c ? this is t!,0
"the game is s !t it looks like minecraft and bo version had a baby, and no matter how good your computer is the game will run about as fast as a fat person with a broken leg. before purchasing i went and got a new toaster because i thought it would be easy to run but even my potato can't run it and the servers are so bad, but i heard the game's good on console.. obviously why wouldn't it be, i mean it's console right.. right..",0
"this review's not about the game as such, but the fact i can't even play it. i get to the new profile screen and the ok button or whatever it is isn't visible on the limited screen. i recommend people not waste there time downloading this.",0

"while it is a bit short, the game easily earns it's worth with the mixture of great vocals, setting, and strong characters. the puzzle solving is good, if you're not focusing it's easy to get lost, and some problems take a bit of out of the box thinking to complete them. don't use a guide your first time, struggle a bit, and remember to keep exploring and messing around.",1

"its a fun game, but its also full of misery in the same fashion that oregon trails and organ trails for that matter, but organ trails is far easier than this does. your performance entirely depends on rng not casually tossing you an enemy you have no chance of beating, so its pretty tough. but its a lovely game nonetheless",1
squad based but unless you plan on paying for a monthly subscription you cannot easily get into games with friends. also game has a freeze bug that when scoping in on rare occassions it will lock your pc up. if you want to spend more money buying items in this game than it would cost to go buy modern warfare go ahead. but my suggestion is to just go get a big title fps.,0
so i just finnished the game and saddly it falls short of its predecessors in my humble opinion. there are a few easter eggs in there but all in all they should have done a far better job of it.,0

i.. i can't even possibly describe how unbelievably awesome this game is w makes me feel like i'm playing earthbound for the first time once again. it's wonderful. them feels lt,1
"meh-ish game. george and nico back in action. with bad graphics and bad controls. nothing like the previous games and so much 'point-and-click' action mostly because it's keyboard only the story is fine, but the puzzles are nothing new. also they tend to get annoying since you have to move with keyboards, risking to avoid something important because you are not facing it the right way. also there were so many boxes god, how i hated them and stealh riddles that it was the exact opposite of you would expect from broken sword. still, i think it's an ok purchase but for fans only",1
even for free i simply can't find enjoyment here or warrant spending more time on the game. i'm only interested in single player aspects so this game just does not cut it in that area which is expected as it wasn't designed with pleasing both groups. the single player is tacked on for preparing you for the online.,0

"runetone keeper is one of those titles that aren't worth the full price and since there is no neutral vote, i have to not reccomend it. grab it for half price or less and it'll be nice game to spend couple of hours. as description says it's quite classic roguelike, not very complex, but still hard with rng ragequits.story while interesting is a bit basic and hard to follow due to random popups with part of it. music and sound is very basic. replayability is good, quite few classes, some unlocks and hidden bosses to grind for. sadly game is still quite unbalanced some weapons items are just useless and since it seems not developed anymore and doesn't have mods, you'll have to stick with vanilla and it's quirks.",0
"coupled with left dead and with all of the downloadable packs included too, this is certainly worth the value in buying. this game also has longevity it's still being played many years after it's release and a great way to bring friends together over the internet. the game is fast-paced, it forces you to think and act on your toes to defeat the nefarious special infected which now include the charger, jockey, and spitter, along with many varieties of special common infected. the subtle undercurrent of tactics to fast paced shooting really helps this stick out among the -loads of zombie shooters out there. not to mention the addition of memorable characters such as the jolly, food-obsessed coach, mischievous redneck ellis, and snide mobster nick, and i guess rochelle too.. be sure to play this. it is a blast.",1
you really can't beat this game for the price. so much fun with a friend!,1
"i was heavily dissappointed by the experience of this game. it's rather glitchy and feels like almost no love was put into this title. the acting is okayish, the graphics could use alot of touching up, and the story was crappy. i am sad i wasted my money on this title when it promised so much. it does manage to deliver on most of them but not in the way most people would imagine they would be. if you really like transformers, you may find yourself dissappointed by this mediocre treatment. if you want this for the gameplay, it's pretty mediocre there as well. this game is mediocre in general and they could have done better.",0

"doesn't work on mac i have purchased this game so i could play this on my mac while i am away from my home pc. it works fine with windows despite the bugs. the mac version however only loads the main menu and fails to even play the tutorial or create a single player campaign. very lousy considering they put the steamplay logo and osx windows compatibility. probably an ok game, but this is strictly compatibility issue",0

"i thought it would be refreshing to have a co-op arcade style game like the old gauntlet legends but gauntlet fails to live up to its predecessor. the melee characters are useless and the mage will end up taking all the kills which will have a co-op pair fighting for gold and kills instead of working together. the levels are redundant and the main kill mob is composed of monster spawners. the camera can trap you or your friend as you run through the level and it is easy to get stuck in the small doors during the chase levels. overall, i would not recommend this game and if you want to play it wait for the price to go down to - because that is about how much it is worth.",0
"feels like a fancier version of dragon's lair. sure, you get to have rd person control here and there but for the most part, it felt you just press forward button to advance the script onwards. over the top action all the time, which was exiting at first but quickly wore off when they do it a dozen plus more times. . game.",0

it was roughly year ago when i purchased ace of spades action rpg fps adenture game. the game full of deception and lies and sometimes sw astica bunkers. i assumed being able to build dumb and have a battle would be cool but no they had to copy minecraft and blocks are too big now i cant see out my creations and get shot in the head by cheaters because the game has a weak anti cheat so script kiddy year stay at my moms house and eat fritos all day can laugh because he thinks im mad but really im laughing at his tubby . well im done im not even going to finish the review because this game fails so hard it makes the piece holding my testicles ache through my fallopian tube and cause gastrial pains which might lead to cancer so i better uninstall this excuse for a game,0

"'free'? not really. what's free is a single table - there are currently more, but you'll have to pay to unlock them, and in my opinion, they're too expensive, at least if you want a few more that a couple singles. and the free table isn't particularily good either, so spending money on something that may or may not be better, isn't tempting.",0
still just as good as you remember. m,1
better than aliens colonial marines.,1
i really dont reccomend this game. at all this game is just another mmo game trying to be cool by adding flying horses and whales even though there are better versions of this game like runescape world of warcraft its laggy i know this is the beta but they have had time but all they did was make little patches and announce them like there something. this game is very annoying the characters are annoying the flying mechanics are great il give them that fighting mechanics are also great but whenever you enter a world it becomes lag i dont reccomend this game atleast until they hotfix some stuff.,0

"amazing lightsaber simulator, and probably my favorite game on the vive disclaimer, i'm a huge star wars fan . it is so fun finally feeling like a saber-weilding jedi. the game itself is simple but sooo fun in its main level, deflect lasers shot at you from a floating spherical droid that moves around in a corridor infront of you think luke in a new hope training on the millenium falcon, but you can see . there are varying difficulty levels, the hardest of which is actually quite difficult. i usually put one of the vive controllers on the floor and play with only one saber. i also make sure my star wars spotify playlist is blasting before i step into vr on this one haha. the bonus desert temple level is amazing! if you thought the original game was fun, wait till you try that. would recommend to anyone with a vive. i usually show this to my friends as one of their first vr experiences. also endless replay value for those wanting to hone their lightsaber skills for the inevitable day when ben kenobi arrives at their door.",1

"a big dissapointment. having followed the development closely since the announcement, i was looking at this as a medium-paced transport tycoon with intuitive controls and a strong element of money mamanagement. what came out at the end of the tunnel was undoubtedly a beautiful game but the pace is so, extremely slow and it is very difficult to remain enthusastic and keep playing. the 'intuitive controls' are worse than that of cim and sim city, i found myself getting very frustrated trying to build a basic road when some road or rail section about a half mile away was preventing me from doing it. a bug? perhaps but it happens constantly and becomes a burden very quickly. i can go on and on but if you are looking for a railroad tycoon cities in motion spin-off or similar game then check out openttd. it's free. i see that the developers will be continuing updating train fever which is a good sign, i'll copme back and re-review at some point. makle it work the outlay.",0

"i really hate to leave a bad review for a game especially one with so much potential but this is the most ridiculously difficult game i've ever played! basically what you do is press buttons that spawn warriors that protect your castle while attacking the enemy castle on the opposite side and you also have spells that damage the enemy however the buttons take time before you can press them again and the enemies are coming at you the whole time and they also have spells that kill your troops pretty much as soon as they're spawned, no matter how hard you try it's almost impossible to hold them off and there's nothing you can really do to make it easier other than upgrades that don't seem to do anything since each level increases dramatically in difficulty anyway. i would have really enjoyed this game if it weren't so impossible.",0

"hours in and im uninstalling this single player mmo, this is no gothic game. even the massively buggy gothic at least had a fun open world to explore. this is just a series of locked zones you move around in looking for random fetch quests and hidden items of the same type to unlock high level gear late game. lack of classic gothic skill up and stats have been replaced with a sterile point buy system. the crafting interface is well done but it amounts to mass producing buff and healing potions. all the gear is incredibly static and leveled. you find a massive two hander then later you find a crude club that has more damage on it as an early upgrade till you find a new two handed sword with higher damage. skip this one and play risen. its much more involved and has higher production values. though i gotta say arcania has great graphics and looks fantastic.",0

"all joking about friend-zoning or falling for straight girls aside, i feel like i would have liked this game more if it had options to allow the user to actually act as emily's friend rather than a creepy control freak. as it is, none of their correspondence rang true to how someone actually worth knowing would handle this situation. which might have been fine if the narrative was condemning those reactions, but that just wasn't the feeling i left this game with. tldr not a broad enough emotional range in the options, so not really my thing.",0

"this game is great and origional. the fact it gives you a story line to match up with being a high classed thife is completely unpredictable. it borrowed some aspects from assasins creed, but that makes it feel right at home for gamers like me. you know your on the evil side of the game but still do good while robbing everyone of their posessions. the combat style is complete with offensive and defensive artillery.the storyline is slow to progress but it uncoveres more and more of the charicters backround. out of . my only complaint is the balances between creeping around and straight up killing everyone you see is a little off.",1
"i don t care what people say, but mostly them was about trash talking about the game. the game is a standalone version of a game from roblox named 'deadzone' which probably infestation implemented some features like the bank. but enough of that, the game is great, i got a bit of problems with servers thou. however i still strongly suggest this over getting dayz, but i gotta say miscreated is better!",1

"this is a game that only a creator could love, though even that may be a stretch. between the highly questionable frames to the painful controls and broken jump feature, i couldn't find any good points beyond the idea and the wall textures, which thanks to the wonderful framerate, i ended up getting very well acquainted with for most of my time. even my masochistic enjoyment for painful and nearly broken games wasn't enough to get me through this trainwreck, which is really quite a feat on its part, not many games are so broken that even i don't want to touch them. so, in short, unless you have a deep distain for someone, are rich beyond reason or just have a phobia of good games and money give this game a very wide berth! then again, those really are some nice walls..",0

if you're into this kind of game and have an immeasruable tolerance for bugs go for it. as in its current state i'd classify it as beta. game breaking bugs left right and center. don't even start about the poor performance optimisation. i'd recommend you to wait till a sale comes along. hopefully most of the bugs are fixed by then.,0

"graphics are good engine is okay setting is quite nice don't wait for balance, play those 'compstomp maps' thats more entertaining than their view on 'balance' con's pathfinding is quite 'experimental' if you ask me if not 'suicide' first they had achievements that gave you bulletins tiny buffs to specific units for you to use , meanwhile archievements are worth and meaningless- they don't give you anything. the bulletins you get randomly if at all from playing the game atan rate that implies that they think you do play their game out of for the next ten years.. i.e. don't waste your energy you won't get what you want but you can dump exorbitant ammounts of money into their dlc's. fazit buy if its low price on sale if you like ww rts and if you don't give a flying xxxx about balance and avoid dlc's .. actually i should say 'avoid the whole thing till they get customerfriendly' but..well the game is actually fun - if you got low expectations.",0
i would recomend fixing the bugs with the graphics cause some people don't have nice computers that can handle high quality graphics for that reason i am not recomending this game until the bugs get fixed!!,0
"binding of isaac is as incredible as it is simple. you can run in four directions and you can shoot in four directions. however the replayability as over hours playtime on my account proof is unimaginable. wanting to rerun the game and always thinking that it could still get better keeps one playing the game. the graphics surely are a matter of taste. they have a nice cartoony look but still is quite gory at the same time. the music is great. for a game that you're probably going to play for countless hours you need a fitting music that doesn't make you want to cut your ears off. and the melodies in this game surely manage to avoid that unpleasant incident. they are almost kind of subtle and somehow manage to be catchy at the same time. the controls, again, are really simple but fit the game since you really only can run, shoot and use some items. so in my opinion a simple 'yes' doesn't quite fit this game. i would rather go for 'hell-a doodle yeah' or something similar in meaning.",1
"i just can't recommend it. believe me, i've tried finding redeeming qualities. it has multiplayer if that counts? i suppose it could be a fun game with friends for like minutes? the game is just very unfinished. and will remain this way there are better games in the genre that are free flash games.",0

"i played the original when it came out..back when i was still in highschool on an amiga no less . i loved the game and the graphics back then, i giggled when the opening scene started with the original graphics..then became more pretty as the opening sequence shows you the upgraded graphics. the redone music is really well done. i didn't really care for the voiceovers, but if you turn the voice sound off, the gameplay is exactly like the original, including color changing text for each pirate talking. the puzzles and going through the motions of playing the game are the same too! i really like how they re-animated lechuck with the ghostly vapour trails as he walks. so, in short, enjoy the puns, the bad pirate jokes, and remember, darts and grog don't mix.",1

"hook is a short, simplistic, minimal puzzle game. the objective is more or less to remove certain hooks in a specific order without colliding with other hooks in the process. very simple in concept, but this game plays surprisingly well, i enjoyed my time with it. some puzzles are much easier than others, the first for example can be completed in mere seconds, but as the levels go on, you will notice the rise in difficulty as you begin contemplating every move you make more and more carefully. the simplistic and atmospheric music is a very nice touch too and fits the theme of the game. for the sake of the standard asking price being ., i would definitely recommend this game to puzzle fans. i would write more regarding the game itself, but there honestly isn't much else to say. it's short, simple, sweet and deserving of a sequel.",1

"this game basically takes the premise of no man's sky and blends it brilliantly with the gameplay of terraria. while i'm not a huge fan of survival games terarria is literally the only other survival game i've bothered playing , the space travel and planet-to-planet environment variety makes this game great fun. the plot of the game is somewhat lacking, but i've had far more than my fill of entertainment contstructing farms and friends in multiplayer. this is a definite reccomendation for anyone who likes terraria or minecraft-esque survival games, with solid content for both adventurers and builders alike. however, it is quite cpu bound. i would reccomend you stay away if you're running an amd chip- i friend of mine running on a fx- often suffers from terrible frame drops when it rains. if you're running fast dual core or a quad core intel cpu, you should be fine.",1

"gameplay wise, it's addictive. all classes and monsters are balanced so well and despite there being a limited number of each, the variety of maps and gamemodes does lend a variety of scenarios. the multiplayer plays out differently with each gamemode and lends itself to both the casual and competitive gamer. it falls short though on price, for and dlc being a pop at best, the marketing strategy emplyed by k games was not a good one. hopefully they can rectify this in the future or its worth waiting till a sale happens to buy it, but if you have the cash don't hesitate! also been noticing a couple problems with randomly failing to load into games, it will reach roughly then stay at that point which gets fustrating! post launch the devs need to focus on ironing out these issues, evolve deserves a really good respoonse from the community.",1

"banner saga is a good game that appears to be held back from its budget. the opening scene is beautfiully animated and well voiced but by the time you're half way through the game you will have not seen another fully cinematic scene and have heard voice acting only a few times. its a shame because banner saga has a beautiful art style and the dialogue is so well written. every aspect of the game seems held back by a lack of a budget, the world is interesting but the ways in which you experience it are recycled over and over the combat is fun and challenging but because of the lack of different enemy types can make it stale at times. one wonders how could this game could of been if they had more money. but there is hope they are working on second part and maybe if they make enough money off part one they can make a game that is truly great. out of",1

"tl dr it's not a bad game, but you should think carefully about whether or not you are the target audience. on paper, spacechem sounds exactly like my kind of game. it's a playful take on concurrent programming, and on top of that, it's themed around chemistry. i like puzzle games. i like programming. i like chemistry. surely i will like spacechem then, right? unfortunately not. i tried really hard to enjoy this game, but each time i play, a very distinctly nagging feeling hit me i could just be programming. the game isn't bad in any notable way, and i actually had some fun playing it. but i just have so much more fun actually programming. this will be a 'buyers beware' to the kind of people that get irritable during handhold-y tutorials and on-rails games. spacechem is a game. not a sandbox. this game boils programming down to two concepts solving the problem, and optimizing your solution. there is going to be one single 'best' solution to the problem at hand, and your solution is going to be either optimal or sub-optimal. end of story. here is why you will probably like this game",0
"the first game i won from steamgifts, for free, so not entirely sure. the story itself is kind of fun, the quality of the game is good, no major wrap ups, then why isn't it marked recommended? well, simply said, a few small things do tend to feel act strange. - having to fill a bucket with water different times or so, only to destroy them when you find the place that you need a bucket of water why don't you keep the first bucket, for future use? - having to go back, because suddenly a search spot has something but before, it wasn't there? - hundreds of undead pirates bound by oaths, but barely any on the island - story makes the game fun once, but you need probably run throughs to finish the achievements as said before, most of the boxes of the game are ticked, it's fun, lighthearted, not too dark, not too easy, and keeps you captivated, but this is the time i needed to find all the achievements.. so, if you see it on a decent price off, or on steamgifts, it is worth your time, just not at full price unfortunately..",0
"city simulator of the era. really hard to manage, very challenging. every building has impact to every aspect. need to play more to gain more understanding. naisu graphic, but not the bgm. i can become mayor of the city in reality because this game lol - hate small text of the game. out of p.s don't put poo pipe from upstream",1

"i've actually enjoyed my time in the game, if you only have time to play it for or hours every couple days it's ok. but it's one of the biggest let downs out there, not worth investing time. the no man's sky is slightly more entertaining than this.",0

don't waste your money on this trash,0
fantastic game. short but sweet. i especially liked the narration style and way it tells the story. its not something you get alot of and its great. lots of enemies and weapon types aswell to keep it refreshing. glad i got to play through it.,1
"was fun, but company keeps trying to pump the fanbase for money.",0
game was great except for the endless tank battles! good though buy for the steam summer sale price. get the dlc if you can.,1
"so since i have so many hours into this game i feel like i need to make a review. so ill start with a tl dr style and go onto my full review pros fun multiplayer lots of diversity can be challenging at times great waste of time cons sometimes the grind is real early game can be dull wiring is hard for me terraria is a sandbox game similar to minecraft, the difference is that terraria is a d game. in terraria there is always something to do, wether it be getting new ores to building a mushroom biome, you will not get bored for a long time, and if you do. get some friends in on this sweet action! and once you complete the game, take it too the next level and play expert mode. although sometimes the game can be quite dull, especially early on, there is always something you need to do. verdict . out of must buy",1
"short, simple, and effective at making you feel weird.",1
this game used to be popular,1
"this game has given me hours and hours of fun. crossplay with the ps and newly added content are the icing on the cake. portal is such an enjoyable and worthwhile game that i believe a multitude of people have bought, played and experienced this game or its prequel. if you haven't yet, i definitely recommend getting portal . it is just one of those games you have to play before you die.",1

"sure, plat costs a lot. ive never put a dime into this game and i'd say you can play threw and get very powerful without it. it is not p w what so ever, pvp is fair, and you can earn plat by selling prime gear to people. anything can be built, earned, and found all threw out the game. weapons and warframes can be easily built. great free game, very fun, and not much grind or farm. . out of",1
"multiplayer matching server seems to be down. a lan option was available but i neglected to try it as it seemed pointless to use hamachi or tunggle just to play a retail, multiplayer game that isn't 'really' multiplayer. at least update the description to reflect this. also had to install an outdated 'legacy' driver for physx to get it to work at all.",0

"i only recommend this if you don't have anyting else to play and if it's cheap on sale . and if you likes ufo conspericy theory. it's an inadequate action game with strategic combat, but i think the mass effect series have done that part far better. the story is inadequate. out of the combat is somewhat ok. out of but mass effect does it far better the gameplay is inadequate. out of the experience is inadequate. out of total out of this game might be interesting for someone few, but for the majority of gamers out there it will not be good enough to take them away from other games. thank santa claus allmighty i bought this on sale p",0
"ftl has been one of the most interesting pick up games i've ever played. due to my current job and location, i can't just get on skyrim or on an mmo for long periods of time. so a quick pick up game would be ftl. its a great little story telling pick your own destination adventure in space! while many people are big into tf 's hat idea, this game i get to work and earn towards different ships that all vary in one means or another. i'm not a big fan of using robots, so i learned how to defend against people with robots. sometimes i'm really geared to fighting with robots and automations, so we got a ship or two built for exactly that. there is plently of possible combinations of in game content within the story line that makes the whole trip of traveling across expanses of space a fun and exhilirating when you got a massive enemy armada just a few steps behind you. i really recommend this game to anyone who is into space games, adventuring, pseudo-role playing, or anything in between.",1
i dislike this game s it has little gameplay as i actualy coquered it in seconds i do not recomend it as it is a waste of money do not buy this game,0

"i wanted so badly to like this game, but i can't. the player base was non-existant after about two and a half weeks from launch and playing this game solo is just not fun. this game is dead and just not worth your time.",0
"the soundtrack was ok. other than that, super cliche and boring.",0
"it looks like an awesome game and i wish i could say it is, but hours after i've come to realise that the combat mechanics are not balanced very well. with that said, this game take a lot of time to get used to, a lot. the game is very disheartening to new comers and has a very long and very steep learning curve. if you have the patience and bravery to sit through hours of frustration with the game mechanics as well as playing against those who exploit it while you have team mates slicing your back off, then good on you. however, for the most of us, its not worth it. you could spend your money and time on a better game. oh and lets not to mention the amount of lag in the game when teamfights break out is astronomical, top that with a poor community given it has improved a lot, and you're friendly with them they're friendly back, but don't expect people to have any sort of decency otherwise and the game is just not worth the time or money.",0
when i first got this game years ago on dvd i fell in love with it from its gameplay system to its story. this game is what introduced me to the rts genre and it is because of this game that rts games are what mostly fill my steam library. overall with its two amazing dlcs i think this game is well deserved of an extremely good review.,1
do you like getting shot by trigger happy teammates and camping? then you will like insurgency.,0
"very awesome twin stick shooter! controller is prefered but i played it great with mouse and keyboard! if you like games like alien swarm, robotron, or any number of twin stick games. you owe it to yourself to pick this up! graphics are great. controls are spot on and tight. rpg elements, ability to build defences like turrets. this should be on everybodys list.",1
buy this game if you want to sit a table and listen to character banter amongst gaming icons. do not buy this game if you want to sharpen your poker playing skills.,0
loadout for me grate game needs some work but i was verry enjoy able,1
although this game is very demanding when it comes to computer requirements i find my self not being able to stop playing it. i have a low-end computer that gets about fps when i play this game but it's so well made the lag doesnt stop me. being able to play as different factions and downloading new maps from the workshop keeps this game fun even after you finish the campaign and the dlcs. company of heroes is visually stunning and the gameplay is addicting so i highly recommend this game as it is once of my favorites.,1
"this game is just awesowme, the story, the design, the..everything! it is just amazingly amazing. it has awesowme songs and a level editor stuff and stuff, i dont eaven know what to say, it is one of the best games i' ve ever played, ever.",1

"a promising start with beautiful presentation and an interesting selection of quests to spice up the early turns. however, the tech tree is utterly bland basically two categories of technologies the vital ones you have no choice but to take and the ones granting a flat or percentile bonus to one of your resources and, combined with the unexceptional combat-system, makes the late game a drawn-out, meaningless chore. for empire management, stick with civ for tactical turn-based battles, with homm .",0

"bugs, balance, broken vehicles. don't bother wasting your time on this game, once you get to the higher tiers balance is completely gone and the bugs disappearing invisible tanks, sparking, lots of desync and hit detection issues . gaijin's strategy to get you to pay for premium or premium vehicles is to make you want to pull your hair out while you are driving a stock tank. unfortunately money will not fix the aforementioned problems, it'll just make your wallet lighter and stress levels higher. skip this one until somebody makes a decent competitor, right now they have no competitor so there is no real incentive for them to fix the game.",0
the worst thing in this game is it's community.,0
"shall we gather for whiskey and cigars tonight? unfortunately not, the game is poorly optimised for pc, it has stunning visuals and a new combat system. however it is not worth getting yet until arkane studios releases a patch to fix performance issues.",0
"dead by daylight is a fun game. however it runs terribly. the graphics themselves are pretty decent, but definently not something my computer shouldn't be able to run on the lowest setting. i know it says gb ram and a whole bunch of other specs my computer doesn't have, but i can still play the game as a survivor with a small amount of lag setting my resolution to render to , my resolution to and playing on low obviously. if they do ever fix the lag and make it playable without having to do a bunch of extra things, i will change over. however since this basically stops people from playing it deserves a no. it's also worth noting people with higher specs also have issues playing, so that's something devs really need to work on.",0

"i can't believe i spent on this garbage game. how did they ever get a games workshop license? they just patched and it's still a horrible game. i keep trying to play it, and every time i log out . how is this even a shooter in ? vehicles are completely undriveable. netcode is a laggy mess. nothing like the planetside which was a comparison selling point for me. as expected, everyone is playing space marine so get used to getting decapitated by them. non-random gameplay modes look like this players in queue space marines , chaos marines , orks , eldar dated graphics even on max settings. chaos marines get a flamethrower that demolishes vehicles in seconds flat.. not sure there is a balance team behind this. just don't buy it. don't do it. save yourself the trouble. the netcode is terrible. i don't write reviews, but every time i play this piece of , i want to come here and expand on my vitriol. no man's sky is a better multi-player game than this.. update -- still a wreck. still bad netcode where you get instagibbed by dudes with chainswords.",0

"this will be confusing, but this is a fantastic game and i believe one of the best sonic games ever made. i won't go further that except very good launcher, the main point is you cannot play it. no one with windows and above can play it. i state this opinion with research as i did absolutly everything, changed combability to xp service package to get one extra load screen before main menu - then it crashes. it's a waste of money till a patch update happens. do not buy till this is fixed! if manages patches updates, it's worth the effort to make a patch. remove it from the store, if average computers cannot run it. i have a computer that can play titanfall on high, do the math.",0
"don't be deceived by 'enhanced edition'. this is a great game in a pathetic release. you should just give me the budget for the game next time and i'll get some modders together and do a better job, and ive never even made a videogame. what i would have done -improve the interface, its old and confusing, make it easier to navigate and understand -fix the inventory filling up with garbage too easily, and inventory management which just slows down the fun -graphics options resolution, various filters like anti-aliasing, xsai, sharpening, bloom, hdr, etc.. -i would have diverted all resources away from producing new content and devoted it to improving the original release -found the original graphics assets and convert them to higher quality versions -touch up the original graphics assets to improve their quality, at minimum improve all character sprites",0
"the good -amazing pixel art -fun and addicting gameplay -strategies make you feel smart -stunning soundtrack -retro arcade style -flawless execution -hilarious item character descriptions the bad -game is almost always fun, but makes sure to ft at least once by the time you make it to the final floor. -difficulty modes easy and too easy mock you. important notes -games usually take a long time to complete - hours each . this is both good and bad, since it provides many hours of gameplay while you try to get all the ships and characters, but requires a large time comitment. -game is largely strategy based. if you want to maybe try out strategy games or a fan of strategy games, this game is amazing. if you don't like strategy games, you are not going to have a good time. overall rating . out of great game",1
so fun to play with friends.,1
"i was about to buy the rest of the heists this crimefest, then the first day happened. let's see how they clean this mess up. if they don't.. well, it was fun while it lasted. edit while most of the issues have been solved due to what we can call 'damage control' , overkill will remain stained by miserable marketing campaigns such as the aforementioned crimefest and the hype train. review will remain negative.",0
"i'm really sad for giving deus ex mankind divided a thumbs down, but at its current state, it's the only thing i can do. the port is truly disastrous, hence the stuttering and crashes, even though i exeed the recommended requirements. turning the volumetric lighting and contact hardening shadows off, to an extent, didn't improve my frame-rate since it was all over the place, ranging from to fps below most of the time . fyi, msaa was also off. fix this sh t, square enix and nixxes!",0
"i got this game for free and since i played other cod's before i decided to give it a shot. i played this game for hours, ing hours, and that is all of my time i will give to this game. multiplayer is full of hackers, and you will find them in almost every single lobby, and nothing will be done to punish them so they will just keep going, and that destroyed this game for me. i havent played one match that i can say i enjoyed playing. and all that fun can be yours for only . euros. dont buy it! dont. rather buy black ops or , mw , eh rather buy bejeweled than this. i would ask for refund, but like i said i got it for free, so that is not going to happen..",0

"lugaru really grossed me out. it's a bunny martial arts game that starts by introducing you to a village, for the sole purpose of the emotional reaction of having those characters killed off by bandits offscreen. you pretty quickly run into bandits that remark on the fun they had with a cfamily member. i felt like it was a pretty narrative arc to throw at a person and i have never loaded it up since. i'm hoping folk can learn about the scene before they encounter it. i really feel like some concepts shouldn't be thrown around willy nilly in media where folk are seeking entertainment and not cheap plot switches.",0
good game if you 're into fps strategy games. insurgency requires lots of strategical movement through the map and good game sense to counter enemies.,1
rubish! never lets me reset my password!! out of,0
games really fun when you get into it but there is no real tutorial which kind of makes things harder than they need to be. each class works a little differently and the summoner class in particular isnt very easy to understand. i ended up having to play or matches to figure him out and i havent even played as other classes yet. at the in or main lobby of the game there isn't much explanation for what the npc's do. based on the game you can predict a shop keeper that sells objects or a craftsman. but there isn't much of an explanation for why you would wwant to use them i havent had to use them much at all and upgrading objects and how most things work need to be figured out. imo i would have just liked the game to tell me what everything does right off the bat so i dont have to spend so much time figuring things out. in short the game needs to do a better job of explaining itself.,1

"this is not a bad game at all. it is well written and enjoyable. nevertheless, the price is not worth the experience. i am thankful for getting it on sale, because it is not worth twenty dollars. i beat the game in less than two hours, and while the whole of the story - including the ending - was very sophisticated and thoughtful, the entirety of the experience was underwhelming. i was disappointed despite the good writing.",0

this game has great mechanics and card design. but i stopped playing primarily because of the community.,0
"i am a fan of the series so i had to play this. i liked the characters and the story, but that's about all the things i liked. unfortunately the game does not raise to the expectations - the action is linear and your choices don't seem to matter much. the interaction points are few and far in between. if you are a fan of the series and want to see a h episode with very little interaction, this will the all right for you. but you will be disappointed if you expect to be engulfed in the experience and to feel like a character in this story.",0

"pretty though it is, as a roguelike, shattered planet should be judged primarily by its gameplay, which is sadly lacking. you can equip only one weapon and one piece of armor, plus whatever consumables you can find and you won't find many . there's no concept of activated or even passive skills, either gaining experience buys you stat increases only. as such, combat - and the game in general - is nearly devoid of strategy, infrequently rising above mindless clicking.",0
"action platformer with some pretty bad controls. it's okay if you like old playstation games such as crash bandicoot or spyro. should last you a few hours. for me, the horrendously inaccurate platforming and hit detection make this game difficult to recommend.",0
"ubisoft, you sly devil you. i gave you dollars and you handed me a piece of trash. just to be constructive i will give some pros and cons. pros beautiful game as far as environments and architecture goes. heavy character customization. ubisoft finally cracked the code! no one likes playing outside the animus, instead they just give you some short narrated cutscenes inbetween chapters. cons very unlikable main character with predictable motives. side characters are boring compared to black flag. controls are extremely twitchy. with the game being far more stealth oriented than previous games, this is a major hinderance. certain parts of the game are only accessable online, so if you have a bad internet connection you are really missing out on a lot of content. you'd think a game with such a successful pedigree would of been more quality. out of i'm retiring my hidden blades for good this time.",0
a solid sequel. join the rapture family.,1
"this is a visual novel that falls short. i thought the game was ok, the endings where not very satesfying nor was the game long. if this game had a pricetag on it i woouldn't recomend it. however it's free and that's why i'll give it a possitive rating. keep in mind that this is a visual novel and there is no real gameplay exept reading. if you don't like it don't try this one. there's always a correct answer. wich is is most cases bad . if you're new to visual novels this one is probobly not a good starting point. if you like romance try katawa shoujo. it's not on steam but it's one of the best visual novels i've played and it's also free. if you like stratigic games, try long live the queen. a challenging but fun visual novel.",1

"it would be a suprise if in todays world you get a game that work at release. you pay, you play, you get disappointed. i like the generell idea of it but the gameplay is ! bugs and crashes make it unplayeble at this moment in time. there need to be a bugfix wich is about - gb and a dlc for and then you can actually play this game. this is how it works today.",0

"reason for not recommending this game is just like everyone else not recommending it - dlc. the other reason i have for not recommending this game is that it seems quite hard to find players at certain hours so you end up playing with bots, which is really not worth it at all. i believe this game will die out in a few months, its already getting really repetetive and i've just played it for hours so far, and now it feels like for me to actually get enough 'energy' to continue playing this game i need to put another to get the extra hunters, so i can try something new. so the way the game is made, you will end up spending a lot more cash than you should have to in order to stay interested in the game.",0
"this is mainly in response to a lot of comments i've read in positive reviews about how good the writing is. i was really disappointed with it, and was hoping for much better writing, and though there isn't anything wrong with it, it really is very standard stuff, and not very original or entertaining. the gameplay mechanics are fine, as are the graphics, and i like the concept of being sent to an underground world, i was just really really disappointed by the writing. perhaps it gets better, but for the seven hours i've played, it wasn't good.",0
"had a problem that months with k couldnt fix, and steam refused a refund",0
"when i first heard about this game, i was surprised. it sounded like either a joke, or something that involved rc cars. not helped by yogscast being where i first heard about it. they have a habbit of being more comedic in their game play. that was in july . three months later i was given a controler and was introduced to actual play of the game. it felt fine, but i was still not entirely interested. then the review on mmo grinder happened. it dawned on me what this game is best at. this is game built for pick up play. do you need much practice to play a game? no. is the game as fun to watch as ity is to play? yes, comeplete with v bot match on all-star be the the best case of 'me get ball.'",1
a good beat em up game. becomes much more fun when playing with friends. out of cedar approved,1

this game is t because it dosen't work i rated -. out of,0
incredibly awesome game.. ..unfortunately too short.,1
"pros brilliant game, perhaps the best in the total war series. fantastic graphics, relativly low system requirements, interesting gameplay and a good community that is largely active. cons the ai for the game is relativly weak and there are bugs in the multiplayer mode which means you can't join games you can still join multiplayer games but not all of them . so overall i would definetly reccomend napoleon total war to any new players or existing players of the total war series.",1
best game ever but it's so scary,1
that gme is so scary,1

"undertale only for real dog lovers. if you like puns, bullet-hell, and real-impact game choices, pick this game. great music too!",1
one of the worst executioned release of a game i've ever seen! i can sit here and write a long disaproval of this title but i'd rather you buy it and write a long rant about it yourself.,0
i'll always come back to this game to play it when i have no other games to play,1
"the game is good, but i purchased a pack and handed them out to friends. shortly after, i found out that hits do not register on enemies by anyone but the server host if others aren't right beside him. that's a major downer for multiplayer. all thumbs up on single player though. can't wait until global syncing in multiplayer has been completed.",0
"the sole reason for the negative vote is the control scheme. movement is standard wasd or arrows, but then enter to attack and z x for magic items. i just couldn't get used to it, and there's no option to rebind keys. there's obviously fun to be had, and i would like to finish this game, but with the controls as they are i just can't. with the option to customize the controls, and i would totally recommend it.",0
it used to run fine even tho had to reinstall on every update because it wants gb just to install any updates even hotfixes and now it wont even start just crashes awesome this game its a grind it doesnt deserve the time of day n it doesnt even ing work,0
the action is pretty boring which is basically all the game had going for it when i started playing.,0
"captain's log, stardate .. i have played ftl faster than light pleny of hours now. and i feel the simulated ship in this amusive computer game is for real and my own. it's really hard to take out the final 'rebel ship'. but i belive from the bottom of my heart it's possible..",1
"i bought this game when it cost only euro and i am happy because it's not worth more money. this game really wanted to be as good as system shock but it's a joke. of course i don't say this game is a total crap but it's really not a game i would recommend to someone. i was completely bored after hour of my gameplay. there is so many darkness in this game but it's not even scary and also our opponents are .. weak and useless. plot is not interesting but we can have some fun in finding all of these documents..hmm, anything more ? sounds in the game are made by someone who has no idea how to make some atmosphere, it's just boring. that's why remember - you can check this game but please don't waste your money if it costs more than euro on sale that's my opinion.",0
"there are lots of positive things about this game, but overall i wouldn't recommend it. the puzzles are fairly simple, it's a gentle game and the overall length is very short. all of these could be positives but there's far too much time spent watching your character walk slowly across the landscape, knowing full well what you're going to do when he finally gets there. the overall graphic style is beautiful, but the way some elements of movement and interaction are handled doesn't feel as strong as the basic page turn pop up effect. the music is ok and adds to the atmosphere, but occasionally cuts out abruptly, which is jarring. definitely worth picking up if it's on sale, but i almost felt like i got most of the enjoyment out of this by watching the trailer.",0
"find yourself a great crew and you will have an excellent time with this game. nothing feels quite as satisfying as answering a fallen security guard's pager at the very last second to say 'everything's fine here, except for i shouldn't have eaten those tacos last night', and having it be the difference between a successful heist and getting busted by the cops. just make sure to remember that its a game don't be a .",1
"this game is terrible, when you try to do missions you get killed by people times higer the level you are and they camp at the objectives. this game is not for new players or people who hate grinding. - out of",0
"this game is simply a is great. it might be a few years old, but the ambiance and scares are well done. this is scary on so many levels. the enemies are creepy, sound design is genious and the camera light night shot combined with constant need to recharge makes for a chilling experience. you will yell.you will be scared. this game is still very good and relevant to prepare you for the second game coming soon! my biggest complain is that after facing the same ennemy a few time, it get a little easier to fool their pattern making it easier. but yet, i have not played on hard. the game is also pretty short around hours but playing the dlc is well worth it too and last about more hours and some insight on how everything started. i recommend watching my video ''outlast in a nutshell rest in pieces''. it is a very funny edit of my full h playthrough condensed in under minutes with only the best scares, story moments and many funny edits! just be wary of spoilers!",1
"i was really looking foward to playing this game, but this game really doesn't bother to work properly. it's quite sad to be honest.",0
if you like minecraft and team fortress and battlefield than this is a game for you! update after the update they released a couple months ago they ed up every single thing.you like the rocketeer mode?well you!we're deleting that.and we're replacing that with the same called engineer!wow!and we'll change the name of the game to!instead of ace of spades it's now ace of spades battle builder!woooow!!,0

they had a realy fun game last year. this one blows. the menues take way to long to load.and are badly done. and you do not have the option to play all the cards.'even after buying all you can buy for the set.' so in closing is not even a close runner up to . wast of money .,0
"despite the fact that it's a slow game, it's good for times you have nothing else to do. you just build sell rebuild buy recruit what you need and get out. the world itself won't stand still while you're gone. things can and will happen to you and you need to fix things asap, otherwise you can get in a lot of trouble. it's fun to see things change and to adapt to them ingame. fullice",1
p p grindfest disguised as f p. and the lack of loli characters makes it unplayable.,0
a pretty average game but good overall. i normally love the dbz series and games which is why i brought it. pros .good graphics .good soudtrack .co op quests with players .good plot in storymode .character customisations and leveling up system cons .simplistic combat system no where near as good as raging blast .story mode only consists of fighting and no bonus levels like infinite world did .can get boring and repitive after an hour or of straight gameplay .cpu teammates are usless for help .very bad transformations ssj transformations don't do anything for your character such as add in more combos make faster more stronger other than allow you to spam supers and ultimates which isn't fun just annoying. should have been like rb or bt where the transformations made your character alot different and it felt like you really did transform but overall good game and reccomend,1
this game has some of the best anime s ive ever seen out of,1

amazing game thats even better played with friends,1
"killed some big bugs to bang a cheap , i'd say that's fair.",1
"this game was great on ps , which is where i ended up playing it because the save feature did not work reliably when played through steam. after ubisoft never responded to my emails and steam refused to continue talking to me after i admitted attempting to contact ubisoft, i swore to never buy ubisoft games through steam ever again. that saved me from blowing my money on unity. the game would be great if it worked.. and it doesn't. not through steam anyway. and don't expect a refund if your product doesn't work and don't expect steam to honour local laws and regulations requiring them to provide refunds when the product doesn't work. it is all in the fine print.",0
"brilliant game which can bring hours of fun while fulfiling your lust for power, after a while itr ca get slightly repetitive and once you have maneged to appease ebverybody you get a un realistic or even of the vote has the potential to be an amazing game if it expamds on the basic concept and adds things like multipile parties.",1
best horror game ive ever played,1

this game is not even working this,0
"the game already had dozens of paid dlcs and that wasn't enough. no, you had to add microtransactions. shame on you.",0
"this is more, and not less, of episode one, yet with more cutscenes, more murder, and considerably less mimes. you should, more or less, purchase this episode, less you did not enjoy the first. in that case, a more wise decision would be to skip to the third, less similar and more enjoyable, episode.",1
love this game to death! amazing gameplay and hours of non stop fun soooo many guns to choose from and plenty of dlc to keep you busy for days. i recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a good first person shooter that'll keep em busy for a while. out of would play again!,1

"masterfully crafted puzzle game - pros - visuals are beautiful, audio is simple. both are relaxing. - puzzles are to be understood, not just solved. - strong gameplay simple controls. - no music cons - lack of settings - no music",1
the mouse flickers from time to time. it mostly just happens in the main menu but otherwise it runs very well. great considering it's age and that it could be played on a pc. brings sback so much nostalgia and i look forward to play more of it.,1
"the scariest thing in this game is the 'to be continued..' at the end. please, no more. poor collision detection. movement is maddeningly sluggish. only about - minutes of gameplay at a brisk pace. no checkpoints saves. even with language set to english, the battery count text is still in russian. playing fullscreen with a second monitor, the cursor would move to the other screen and clicks would minimize the game. when resuming the game, mouse look was non-functional. gameplay consists of not getting lost, solving one simple puzzle, and completing one short barrage of qte.",0
tanks also the ending was more rushed than a liam neeson movie.,1
best star wars game the combat is awesome and the game got one of the best mods like movie battles ii.,1
"gameplay is actually fun. shooting and moving is fun. repetitive mission structure, copy paste enemies, a lot of stuff available from start without any sensible progression ruins the experience though. a lot of ruined potential.",0
i wasn't going to try this game because i thought it was ugly but then some gifted it to me. man was i ever surprised. this is one of the most enjoyable games i've played in years. i highly recommend this.,1
it will not let me play it,0
"wow so whackey xdddddd ddddd instead of any actual gameplay, the game decides to go the panic! route and make it entirely a trial-and-error switch puzzle. while panic! did have some pretty amusing visuals and charm, mcpixel just feels like it's trying too hard to be so randum lol!! sadly, being a stupid kid growing up in this generation at the time of it's release, i fell victim to it and gave the developers money. let us never speak of this again.",0
"if it had trading cards, this would still be negative..",0
i cant play the game on my pc it doesnt open wtf please help,0
"bit lacking. -classes are bland and boring. -cant even remember my companions names, thats how uninteresting they are. -loot is meh. -combat is okay. -stoy was bland. -stronghold should have been scrapped, just annoying having the feature there. -choices in the story was okey i guess. could play somewhat semi-evil. -act or the indians act was beyond boring, rushed that . -spells.. could have been great, could have been a decent spirituell sequel to bg , but fell a bit short. you just feel something is off.",0

"puns.. prepare for -- a lot -- of puns. i played it since i heard it was short and got it as part of a humble bundle. it can be amusing at points, but it's humor tends to be pretty stupid and not at all in an endearing way . my recommendation would be to only buy this when it is heavily discounted.",0
"one of the best indie games this generation, the best d platformer in recent years due to perfect conrols, out of - bit nostalgia and has dark world levels that are bat hard.",1
"simple design, but awesomely fun.",1
"very funny game, its not recommend for the humans. its simple and fun if you know how to play it. the look in game is stupid but the depth in game is way bigger then you think in the first place also note you need patience if you dont have it dont play it.",1
"this game sucks and you can only fire in directions, while my computer meets the optimum requirements it lags on lowest settings, also using ideas from the diablo games beter in every way and change them slightly would dislike again",0
"borderlands is a open world multiplayer shoot and loot game where you can take on one of four classes if you have dlc . you start out the game wondering where the you are and trying to get off the glacier with claptrap. as the game progresses you start to find out more of pandora's history through little echo communicators. you can find history on handsome jack, roland, claptrap and the rest of the crew. gameplay wise you will not be bored because there are lot's of side content to keep you busy for hours apon hours. but what will take most of you're time is legendary farming. trying to get every legendary is tough but worth it. if you plan on legendary farming take a couple of friends!! it helps..trust me.. would i recommend this game to new commers of this shoot and loot series? yes!! the first boderlands didn't have much story except gun p rn everytime you load up a new area. so treasure hunters would you like to hear another story heh? well if not to bad i'm telling it anyway.",1
it's.. bad. rating? no comment.,0
its like league of legends if i hated league of legends more.,0
"awesome game! rate it out of cuz main story isn't finished. lmao if they finish the plot rating would go up to out of . dont buy it, unless you want to pay for an unfinished game.",0
"best zombie shooter shooter - not a typical survival game ever. lots of fun with lots of gore - smashing some zombie face in with the baseball bat, cutting off heads with katana, literally ripping them apart with the chainsaw or shooting off limbs with one of the few guns around ? was never so much fun. also, l d now includes all the characters and campaigns from l d , which gives around campaigns, each having to maps with randomized enemy. not very realistic, but answer yourself - how realistic is zombie apocalypse? the game itself is great, and with new mods, skins and campaigns made by the community it's even better. if you like shooting the zombies - you're gonna love it. if you don't - give it a try, maybe you'll enjoy it as well.",1
yeaaaaa man the colors get it for the colors!,1

pros- graphics cons- mostly linear game unlike other final fantasys. hated that if the party leader dies you have to restart. some boss literal can one shot you no mater what hp you are at. so its a mater of luck if the boss doesnt target your group leader. you have to reset roles if you change out any characters. eidolon summons are auto assigned to one toon and u can only cast that eidolon if your party leader has that one..,0

"yet another tower defense game. cubemen has no upgradeable towers. instead of towers you use cubemen duh . they are put on cube blocks and can actually move around freely. but they're not upgradeable. during my playtime it came down to spamming enough men to kill the incoming enemy forces. there were very little tactics involved. there's a bit of fun to be had, i guess. i just expected more strategy from a tower defense game. rating out of",0
"i wish i could give a review on this game. i wish i could praise its strengths and point out its weaknesses. but i can't. because my computer can run planetside , shadow of mordor and other graphically intense games, but this game runs at about fps and the graphics really aren't that good. so basically its a crappy port that doesn't work. avoid this game! i wasted ten dollars on this piece of garbage!",0
"great game, mostly great people with decent team work skills",1
"the first hour or so of this game is terrible, but it exists to really emphasise how important the hacking is. once you get to that stage, the world becomes flexible and the game becomes fun. that said, i didn't think much of the story, but it was worth it to get the satisfaction of creating a bottomless cup of coffee and stealing from everyone across the city. the programming is easy to understand, but the documentation is deliberately hard to get, so you 'level up' through organic discovery, which is a nice mechanic.",1
i can't even get the first fire to go out. waste of money.. i've aimed it everywhere on top middle side..not a good game i want my money back.,0
"awesome game, so simple compared to these shooters. much fun",1
what skyrim should've been from the start. pros -x so better modding -new stock effects eliminating the need for some mods -higher-res armor texture at least k is noticeable cons -no bug fixing mostly old bugs are there but can be fixed -should've been like this from the start.,1
"i usually don't like games like this without some enemy threat. this game is hard as anything without an enemy. i find it extremely difficult and i thought that i was pretty good at this type of game. i encountered no bugs and it runs smoothly. if you like a challenging sim that will never play the same twice then you'll love it, if you need a easy game with warm fuzzy feelings and rainbows then pass on this one.. the game should have trading cards too..",1
"i don't know what to say about this game. its like it was made by a year old genius that never played a game in his life. launch the game and was greeted with a hint with grammar. i never knew someone can ruin the camera work as bad as this game. fighting enemies is like fighting stage cancer its pretty much impossible. lastly, i can't be mlg in this game so it sucks even worst than it already is.",0

this game is really good you can morph your ships in realtime with two view space view and techmorph view and its a rts type game with startrek online type graphics.its well worth the buy at . on steam sale,1
"a beautiful and brilliant game, keeps you entertained throughout and offers such genuinely deep and involving narrative. i could think up some gripes for the game if i really wanted to, like the inventory systems and 'relic' weapons, but overall the experience i had with this game was incredibly solid and well put together. a hearty recommendation.",1
"highly addictive, and relaxing first person shooter.",1
"game is unstable, either get game freezes or random crashes to desktop.",0
"ok, this is aa brilliant game. what else can i say except that really. one thing to note though if you are using an amd cpu watch out as i am currently using a gtx and an fx but get sub fps on low and my firend with a better gou and similar cpu is also reporting similar problems.",1
seriously steam need to review their games.,0

"do not buy this. i don't understand how this is still sold. it does not work on windows and apparently on other versions too . many asked online for help, and no solution has been found yet. i contacted rockstar games support and they ignored me. what happens you install the game and spend - minutes to fix graphic problems, reinstalling missing or old files, giving launch commands on steam and making a social club account etc. no matter what you do, this game will crash as soon as you start the game or for some others, apparently a couple of minutes into the game gta iv fatal error wtv gta iv fatalerror windowstimerfunctionsvalidator check -readfromprotectedbuffer qpcfailed! - either reboot or reinstall gme for windows live obviously, rebooting or reinstalling game for windows live doesn't work. this is a scam, the product is impossible to use, many had this problem and we are being ignored. do not waste money.",0
l.a. noire is a great game that really nails the detective cop theme. although it isn't a very long game it has a lot of great twists and exciting moments that thicken the plot to the very end. i definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for an awsome single player experience.,1
"one of my favourite games to date, if not my favourite ever. dragon age origins allows you to make decisions and interact with npcs and party members in a way that can get you truly attached to their stories. there are so many tales woven into one wonderful, complete and complex campaign which you can, to a fair extent, influence through your decisions. the combat system is very simple to learn but still can be manipulated to fit your style, and you can make this game as challenging or leisurely as you like it. not only can i appraise the obvious, but i can also comfortably say that the attention to detail in this game, right down to the little things like the designs on the armour sets, is set to a very high standard. it's abundantly clear how much work was poured into this game. the only flaw i could accentuate would be that the dungeon crawling does get a tad repetitive, but it's necessary, so if you can forsake a hard. gruelling dungeon crawl and you're willing to give up many, many hours of your life, this game comes with my strongest recommendation.",1
"honestly, this game was a real let down. i played myst and riven when i was a kid, so they were kind of my childhood games. i also played exile and revelations. i expected this one to be the same, but the graphics just got worse which is just..really sad to me , and i beat the game in a few hours. it should not have been that easy. i just feel that this game just did not meet my expectations at all.",0
"i understand the frustration of a lot of people about the randomness, but it is part of the game. i love the interactions and card play.",1
"everything other than quick throw system is good, dont forget to play with headphones on a dark room for immersion",1
disappointing story compared to s .,0
wtf. why this dosent work?? loading..loading..loading..,0
"and the whoooaaaaaaa, dude! award goes to.. no, really, what is going on here, i have been tempted by the cool graphics but then the game is a mess. you are placed right into the game without any useful instructions and your timer keeps going on no matter what, even on 'menus', so you will mostly fail many times until you understand your surroundings, the objective, and how to achieve it properly. the music is somewhat nice, though, matching the fast pace of the game.",0
well not played it so far becuse dunno if it does support keyboard and mouse but when i use then dont working in game,0
"this game is a first person melee game and also the pc port of a console game with all the ups and downds console games have . it plays best with a controler, but mouse keyboard are supported too. the story is mostly linear. aside from a few clearly defined sneak battle places, the player always has the choice to use a sneaky approach or to go in flashing combos, or a combination of those. there is no character development, aside from unlocking new combos and better magic using money. the larger ambushes and sieges have a nicely realized scale with lots of allies foes and the character tipping the scales. the story is strongly anchored in the norse myths and includes a lot of spoken dialog and videos.",1
"can't say i recommend this game. what may pass itself off as fun fps randomness ends up coming out as an unbalanced fps with the dino gimmick only lasting as long as your patience with the game itself. the classes are creative enough but the fun doesn't last when the servers are full of salty little kids who after every single double suicide death make damn sure to type in chat 'xd totally worth it!' or 'worth' that being said you can have some real fun in this game with friends in a server but its not something i would want to revist on my own and playing with friends did get boring after a while. go pick up fist full of frags instead, the game has much more replay value and it doesn't rely on gimmicks and classes to lure players in. or you could ignore all of this and buy it anyways, because jesus look at how many cigars churchill has in his mouth! what a legend!",0
"and now for my after-completion mini-review for pillars of eternity. i've never played infinity engine games back in the day. it still hit me that poe is one of the greatest isometric rpgs in years. the story, the characters durance ftw! , the quests, the music, all full of epicness. the combat was not as fun as in e.g. divinity original sin, another kickstarter triumph, in tactical sense, but it was interesting enough. little minus for having only some parts of the texts spoken, even inside single conversations. good hours with all side quests done, it did not get tiring at all but had me hooked all the way. quality entertainment. kudos, obsidian! out of",1
"well.. i bougt the game because of that i loved gal civ . gal.civ is perfect if you love chrashes and repeating pointless stuff. and of course, insted of fixing the game they make dlc, lots of dlc. because of the abusing of dlc stardoc is now on the black list togeather with paradox.",0
"one of the few lower-budget f p games that's worth playing. lots of content, a fairly decent story, some stunning music and animation, and a lot of fun gameplay. definitely worth trying.",1
"great action rpg, my favorite in the genre right now.",1
"this isn't so much a game as a hr movie that you click through. it's good though. it's a very moving game. as a yr old man who recently turned to game development from an awful marketing job, this is a game i can connect to. it reminds me of how i felt after watching the fountain.",1
it is a very nice game with so much fun,1
"the sequel to the amazing game known as portal. this game takes everything from portal and turns up the awesome factor. i can sit here all day and be a fanboy but i must suggest as always if your in for the story to play the first one to give an idea. - co-op. i cannot tell how much enjoyment me and my bud had when first playing the co-op. it's a bit short and leaves you wanting more. that's where the workshop and mods come in. and the fun of ting around while you and your bud try to come up with the answer to said puzzle. - workshop works well for this game. although, it's only for shorter maps made with a simplified version of the sdk. it's still a blast to look at! if your honestly a valve fan or just want something with a twist and new, you need to pick this up.",1
woah age of empires the game of my childhood. this game is one of the best rts games on the market it's fun and games last a perfect time not to long not to short. age of empires this game goes from medieval to gunpowder . from knight rush to bombard cannon spam . i highly suggest this game to any rts fan or any medieval fan also the dlc are highly suggested although you will probably use african kingdoms over the forgotten they are both still good and bring some sexy kingdoms to the game like the portuguese fielding their organ guns and the ethiopians with the mighty shotel warrior cheap faster then a horse and can be spammed to tim buck too . if you have no life like me you can sink hours into this game i've got hours in days in this game alone . it's cheap it's fun out of,1

"it's fun for the first minutes. the cute characters, the concept of building a broat. then it's down hill for me. it begins to grind. the gimmicks are clear cut, the mechanics are simple and i realize i'm just playing an annoying matching game. if you like typical matching games with some extra crap, check out the game. if you don't, or find grinds boring, you can safely skip it. all the humor is shown in the previews. there isn't much else.",0
its a lot of fun especially if you play with other people!! it's a little addicting if i may say so myself!! i would definitely recommend the game to the gamers who intend to improve their refrexes and teamwork reliability!!,1

"so i'm adventuring around, killing zombies in kf and blowing up cowboys in fist full of frags, when suddenly an urge envelops me. i desire a game where i control miniature goblins guarded by a giant troll, that can get two shot by a minotaur leader. in all seriousness, this is a really fun, really interesting game that reminds me a lot of the old black and white games. it's nowhere near as indepth or having the same mechanics, but the feeling of looking after your little goblins by controlling this big troll is just nostalgic as hell. i do have a few gripes with the game the control methods are a bit clunky, the ui could be better designed and the goblin management could be far better than slider bars. but all in all, it's still incredible. if this was a paid for game, i'd give all my money. please keep improving this, or at least make a sequel! d just don't fall into micro transaction hell and i'll love you forever.",1

"i think i already reviewed it. or was going to then decided it wasn't worth it. whatever. game looks okay in screenshots, because when nothing is happening, the game looks better. this game just sucks, don't waste your money. could get you a game a lot better than this one. trust me. it's unfulfilling in every way. the zombies suck, the story sucks, it all sucks.",0
"the real question is why wouldn't you buy this? it's cute, and a decent game.",1
"kinda got boring fairly quickly. sticks with the tried and true 'goverment is the bad guys' thing from the start. the gameplay seems to be trying to do too many things while not really excelling in any aspect. the game bored me before i got to see too much of the stealth, but the combat felt stiff and the bosses were just uninspiring. not the worst game i've played, but pretty boring.",0
"pretty grounded in reality compared to later saints row games. unfortunately, this instalment, before the updated engine of sriii has aged very badly. on top of that, the pc port is pathetic. terrible frame rate my ti should have been more than enough to handle it objects floating away from eachother in every cutscene with some pretty funny results. none of it makes the game unplayable outside of a few mission failures due to your target getting stuck in a wall or something. ignoring performance and technical prowess, the cars handle well, but the game's really bad at conveying your next objectives putting a tiny marker on the world map and expecting to instinctively know to look for it and know what it means and the game arbitrarily gates off each story mission until you've filled a gauge which you can only fill by completing repetive side missions which start of entertaining but get old very quickly. not a terrible experience, but i gave up on it when i was tasked with a madatory story mission involving flying through hoops in a time limit using a helicopter, and no this game's helicopter controls are a joke.",0

"back in this game made our rigs over heat. i can't add much about crysis from what you already know. the first game has the whole thing in terms of progression and environments. this port is decent i can't say is the best because it has some issues to solve like the stuttering even if you have a monster machine and resolution compatibility but is as good as you remember. the bad thing is that maybe you'll find this at a not so cheap price and nowadays crysis is not on steam to have the whole trilogy. another bad thing is that the local multiplayer does not work as did in the past. i remember shoot rocket launchers from one side of the island to the other with a friend, we were testing our new dell inspiron laptops with geforce m at that time hahaha. another good memory was that this game managed the fov in a way that we tried multiple displays up to and it was a blast back then haha. oh..i forgot..it has a ridiculous rd-party drm for only machines..'only' haha! well..buy this sh t is good!",1

"i really love this game, it's one of the first games i ever played on the computer and it was lovely then, even greater now. tough is it just me who isn't getting any achievements? everything else works fine..",1
"i would really love to like this game.. the story seems interesting, the visuals appear stunning. sadly the camera and controls are just way too janky. it doesn't take two hands and require the use of eight to ten fingers to pick a flower.. unless you're a super natural powered witcher with two badass swords. - i just can't recommend this game to anyone.",0
"awesome game, loads of action and just the right amount of story. works the pc too so will be great in winter to warm up your room!",1
"good game! i know that since i played it back when it came out. steam ripped me off of my nostalgia trip though. it just doesn't work with windows . windows . it worked after a few hours of searching the internet and troubleshooting. but it wasnt satisfying even then. old d accelerated games could really need some sort of compatability layer, something like dosbox. as of now, i will be careful of buying old games on steam!",0
"i cannot, in good faith, recommend this game in its current state. it's not that it's boring or difficult, it's just dissapointing. as a homeworld and player there is a certain level of polish that feels like it's missing. it's not even like it's big things either, but the little things add up to create a sense of a game that's been rushed out. things like the tracks, on tracked vehicles, not even moving. and the suspensions on said tracks not moving. some of the textures look very low resolution too. the ui feels quite clunky, even compared to homeworld! add to that, the game crashed to desktop during the third campaign mission and it seems like there's a way to go for this game to be recommendable. perhaps the developers can put some more effort into polishing and improving on the little things..",0
"this one is about as fun as wichers amp . actually, i think it's more fun to me. it really looks like a desert nuc-halocaust environment. it's a great rpg, rough-tough-going.",1
"this matchmaking is utter ing garbage. how do you wait in queue for over minutes constantly clicking ready over and over again just to get kicked out of a lobby to remake. the game itself isn't bad but if i have to wait that long to play one game everytime, thats just ridiculous.",0
horribale never get it i want my back now!!,0
"got hacked, had to hack them back and copy one of their system files to restore the ui. immersive out of !",1
"its not civ in space if that's what you are looking for. bought a copy for the wife and myself, and while i don't regret it, not sure i'd spend full price on it. worth purchasing if on sale and hopefully the upcoming dlc will add much needed variety to the game. i do recommend this game, but in its current state i give it a . out of , player made mods up that rating to . out of .",1
just sad i load up the game and join a game it says build robot and im like ok i click hull er what ever and then it says we are sorry thats unavalible and then crashes.. go play robocraft way better,0
"if they ever do medieval after the expansions of this game, ca maybe, just maybe, be forgive for rome ii. all in all, its a great new game developed by the company",1
"a total misfortune. this is an excellent and refreshing game idea in a time when so much innovation is needed in the gaming world. unfortunately because of the terrible ai and some other awkward hiccups, it falls far from its greater vision. if you must play it there are some great mods out there to make a significant difference.",0
"to capture a runaway toothbrush you need a mousetrap baited with wasabit peas. to get of the same colored socks you need to mix random colored socks into a pot of boiling water, add soap and stir with a fork. randumb game. puzzles make zero sense with solutions being found by endless trial and error or referencing a walkthrough, over and over and over again. main character is whiny and obnoxious. scenery is decent but character animations look poor and dated. humor is flat and obnoxious. they occasionally try to get people into the series by dropping this title as low as ., so if you want to try it wait for the deep discount, but dont expect much.",0
"fast-paced neon arcade game which is extremely addictive, has very fluent and simple yet unique gameplay and you can choose your favorite colors in my case it is yellow and lightblue . soundtrack is absolute fitting and awesome. sad part is that it is not getting the attention it deserves. absolutely recommended.",1
"really fun and interesting if you like hack and slash with quircky remarks from a npc thats pretty cool to have around, lots of customization altough the quests are kinda one sided.. ha. but i was entertained for long periods of time and i give my hat off to that even though in the game i would of liked just cool hats.. im a stat so when i get a great hat with bad graphics im literatly wondering.. really? do i have to? oh well its all rd person anyways and your usually too busy fighting monsters later on to even see your character.",1
"think of futuristic battlefield. really thats what is basically is but with much more people on a single server. ps is not in anyway a generic mmofps shooter, its unique in its own way. alerts events help with replayability and the progression is nice and slow but it doesn't feel grindy at all. you can play by yourself and still have fun, but when you have a platoon full of people it can get quite hilarious and chaotic! pros -visuals are quite nice. -awesome dev interaction with players. -not pay win. -classes are nice and balanced. -weapons feel like they have power. -the sound in this game is quite amazing. cons -vehicles feels somewhat clunky to me.",1
"growing up as a little kid, i played the first age of empires, once i heard about this newer model, i immediatly bought it, and i love playing this game, has amazing campaigns and multiplayer battles. out of",1
super cool game! totally worth it! probably the v is even better,1
worst tutorial i have ever played in a very long time. convinced me to not play this game.,0
"i recommend this game in may ways. its fun,very fun. its like cookie clicker but x better these guys update the game but the website cookie clicker doesn't. but i still can not figure out how to get forge cores or what the junk piles does in relics.and basically everything about relics. i went to the community on redit and seen what it says and that information still doesn't make sense to me.",1
"it's the same game as x-com , but with more constant, annoying interruptions from captain sweater now mildly grizzled and, somehow, worse storytelling. it'd also be nice to be able to click a button without a damn cutscene. it feels like the game also aggressively wastes my time every time i take an action, by trying to extend them with as many animation flourishes as possible. it's neat the first, to be positive, ten times, but after that it just makes you wish the game would get on with it. i eagerly await when firaxis will start releasing actual games again, rather than full-conversion mods of stuff they've already done, while pretending they've actually spent time programming and designing looking at you, civ beyond earth . if you're buying this at full price, you're being cheated, because there's practically nothing in here that a crew of modders could not have added to x-com over the course of a few months, and most of the actual mechanics changes are negligible or, incredibly enough, make the game worse.",0
"feels very unfinshed and default control layout is all over the place, needs lots more work, i wouldnt recommend it, go out and buy some real lego or play minecraft",0
"while this did give me a brief flash of nostalgia for games like dungeon master which i loved as a kid , i got bored of playing legend of grimrock rather quickly. it's got some good puzzles and exploration is somewhat interesting, but all other aspects gameplay, character creation, combat were pretty uninteresting. maybe i've just moved on from the genre, but i can't really recommend this game too strongly regardless of that.",0
worst game ever xd not even worth cent. graphic is okay tho. out of,0
"if you dont care about the campaign dont get the full game just purchase the starter edition. also please save your money don't bother purchasing the dlc map packs as it is very hard to play a match on them unless there is some x exp event going on for it. other than that its always team death match, some domination and alil hardcore that have players actively searchin for games. a fun game unlocking camos and getting random drops from grinding cyptokeys from playing matches. alot of suspicous players though, some are really good and a few are scripters that cheat. enjoy at your own risk",0
"great runner, one of those games i go back to for - minutes every now and then.",1
main controls are broken wait till patch sad for a full released game,0
"not much to say.. the game is bad, don't get it.",0
a must play game.. nxt level game.. gg d,1
"today i am writing a review of a blank screen, because after three hours of trying i couldn't get the game to even start. couldn't find anything online to help, even tried updating my drivers. restarted several times. still won't start. i don't care if anyone elese gives any praise at all for this game. i want my money back. gg.",0
suuuuuuuuuucccckkkkkkkssss!! i have no idea wtf i'm doing this this game. so boring.. it's so vauge as to what you are supposed to so and it's not interesting enough to just explore. the lanscape is so dark i can't see jack !t !!,0
"great game to zone out to. upbeat soundtrack, collectathon gameplay and pretty visuals make for some good time. out of",1
"this is a super fun game! i love it! just a little thing i found when you're in first person mode and you fall off, sometimes you don't respawn and you have to go to the menu and restart the level again",1
"yeah it's alright feels like a basic version of team fortress only with a dinosaur theme, if you're into that, then i'd recommend, otherwise nah",1
"extremely dissapointing.. to say the least. i've spent only a couple hours with it to be fair but.. the combat is horrendous. slow and sloppy, just not fun. i'm sure the story is decent",0
"excellent game! two-thumbs up! warhammer k lovers, rejoice! this space hulk tbs is sure to make you feel right at home if you love the genre and the dark universe this game is set in. nothing beats pulverising genestealer to a fine red pulp and then trudging over it as you move further down the dark corridor in search of your next target!",1
"i was looking for a game with some technical depth and this game delivers. don't think you are gonna come in here and wreck people because you ain't. this game will overwhelm you at the menus, but this is what i would call, 'a big kid game'. rock em' sock em' with rockets, machine guns and the like. do you understand the physics mechanics of a tank? great. you will do well here.",1
"i got this for free of humblebundle. i don't recommend it. even for free, its really not worth it. they made it in a week and charging quid for it ! come on dev's , you really taking the bisquit there.",0

"i'm not a huge fan of tcgs but this is one of the best i've played, coming into this i was expecting a mediocre game and was actually pleasantly surprised. pros -animations amp card art are really good, some of the best in the genre. -fully voice acted campaign for each hero -they give you packs as soon as you start so you'll have tons of cards right away. -diverse maps -evolve mechanism adds quite a ton of strategic variety. -can run at fps. cons -music can sometimes be a bit annoying especially on the church stage . -over the top fanservice but it's anime what'd you expect . -the screen should be zoomed out further, everything is too close together. -too many unecessary loading screens.",1
bethesda ed this up and its fact or at least for people that were expecting an rpg. . you can't be evil.. sure you can kill people for no reason but you can never truly rp an evil character. . voice.. its the worst thing that could've happend.. not only doesn't my character not sound like i want him to but this also limits the rp so much.. hate it. . immortal children and companions. . power armor is extremely op even at very hard difficulty which i play on and fusion cores are easy to come by. . your characer is pre defined and you forced to play as a concerned father its just.. bad. i could go on but these are my main problems and why i'm starting to hate bethesda.. they should hand the series over to company that knows what their doing like obisidan entertainment.,0
a very entertaining puzzle game. the puzzles have a perfect difficulty curve and can be quite difficult. the icing on the cake is the story though. very well written and preformed beutifully. the only problem i had was the co-op seemed to slow my internet way down. using skype to communicate judging on just the game itself a out of,1
stratagy on an epic scale. you can spend hours just trying to explore an entire map. with live economy in every game you can force an enemy to do your bidding.,1
junk can't even be recycled,0
if u buy the game u will happy but game isn't playable. when u want to play just click play on steam or uplay wait and get cancer. this game isnt working until months ago. please fix the game !!,0
story makes no sense weak combat. would not recommend at all.,0
improves on the first one in literally every single way. stop reading the damn reviews and buy this game already!,1
"if you are looking for bugs, this is your game. you can buy thousands of them for as low as . . you will not find anywhere else an offer like this!.",0
it's great to play with friends on the same computer. flashy and fast but once you play it through you get tired of it out of,1
"turns around corner, sees terrorist, aims, takes the shot, hears a loud noice, teammate screams rpg, dies brutaly in a explosion, hears everyone screaming allahu akbar. note no russians screaming suka bleytj or rash b. out of would join the marines.",1
"this is so awesome! i really like the style and the story. if you usually skip the conversations - this isn't maybe not for you, since there's a lot of talking and waiting. i do think it's really great. it is also fun to see afterwards what choices others have made.",1
"cheap or low budget feeling, no drive to continue playing. graphics look toonish clunky ui horrific quests",0
"ummmm well, can't play coop cuz uplay servers suck .. bootyhole",0
damn hard but extremely addicting and rewarding for those who enjoy a challenge.,1
"bought this game on the cheap on a whim. played over hours and i'm still not done. so much fun, so addicting, great core of progression, love the bit graphics, love the music, love the gear, the enemies, the customization. out of .",1
"this is a short, yet powerful game that hits close to home as i, too, was a high school senior entering college in . the story unfolds in five chapters through a series of instant message conversations in a clever replication of the obligatory im client of the era, aol instant messenger. in the four year span, you will converse with your high school friend, emily, and experience the changes that take place on each individual traversing the crucial molding period of any young adult's life. though my story was bittersweet, it was able to hit a nostalgic nerve on a very pesonal level i cannot say that about many games.",1
about as fun as masturbating with sandpaper,0
i love it when i play the beta it's so ing good,1
"i freaking love this game, it is funny,you could do pretty much anything on this game.",1
"art deco, hot chicks, awesome characters, surprisingly good stories and a great sense of humour. i can't wait for indivisible and this game's basically my distraction until that releases. yes i reccomend this game. yes. buy it. buy it now. don't pirate it and not give them any money you monster buy it. buy it now. buy it more than once so that friends don't have to. or complain to a friend with money enough so that he buys the game and dlc for you because he wants to see you hit small women with musical instruments. also yes that happened.",1
out of would buy again,1
i recommend this game to any one who likes any detective storys.,1
"fun game, it's got over the top cartoon humour and is a riot to play. best yet, it's free to play. can buy customization options for your characters but all the gun stuff just costs blute in game currency and you can also buy spacebucks real money currency",1
"this game could have been so much better, here is a short review.. and sort of rant. total war rome is my favorite total war so was excited for this.. and very disappointed . this is a good rts empire builder game but as a total war game.. i just cant recommend it.. read the full review why. pros",0
"i have very high acceptance of arcade games, meaning - mindless fun of shooting stuff, dodging missiles blowing things up. i don't mind fantasy settings and fantasy manouverablity of planes, that act more like ufos than planes. with that ll said and done, i can't even play this game. i literally twisted my wrist inside out, using logitech extreme d pro, trying to control the craft. i speed up to put some distance between me and the enemy, because the su seems to be flying at balloon speed, or i don't know, my aircraft i'm guessing f x faster? i close on, launch missiles and --- nothing? then i engage the so called 'dogfight mode' or whatever, where the plane is literally inches away from my cockipt and i shoot close range missiles and machine guns, while my eyes are tearing up from the in-out of focus special effects and explosions, while literally ripping apart my joystick. the game should have stayed on ps , i can't recommend this, unless you want to get a carpal tunnel syndrome and don't mind hallucinating from blurred vision after you turn it off.",0
"amazing atmosphere, simple mechanics, brutally challenging.",1
is there anything that can possibly be said about this game,1
"in its current state, i cannot recommend this game. while it promises intereting combat, it fails to deliver. don't get me wrong, i like the ship design system, but ultimately battles become blobs of hitpoints throwing dps at each other. ships don't get damaged, their perfomance doesn't degrade excepting the loss of expendable munitions, they just go from full effectiveness to exploded. i'd have figured in we'd be better than rtses of .",0
so online is still a complete lag fest and completely unplayable. second delays from move inputs. absolutly horrible. netcode is crap on pc. get the game on the console if you must.,0
"overall? a massive disappointment i came back to a couple times in hopes it had gotten better. sadly, it never did. such a shame, i loved being a wheelman for people.",0
its a very fun game. full of funny moments you will never forget. grays mod is in my open one of the best sand box games out there and it is defintly worth buying.,1
"a strategy game with no luck and extreme tactical planning. it's like rainbow six's planning mode meets simultaneous turn-based strategy, and that's just cool.",1
great game for passing away some time,1
"good idea ,but bugs and crashes make it impossible to play even after the . patch.",0
i love this game so much d it has so many mods so if you don't like something thats on there then you can just find another game to play while still playing this game if that makes any sence . but the point is that this is an awesome game and i definatly recomend it.,1
game won't launch and the support is useless. don't waste your money unless you want to spend it on a game that doesn't work.,0
best moba and free play game on the planet. you can't miss this one!,1
so many hours of fun. even after the story is finished i am still playing this. says alot if i can be bothered to play after the story in a sandbox game.,1
"this is probably the best designed x game on the market. so why do i not recommend it? the forced iron-man monthly save requirement is overkill. either they need to fix the saving to be in the background and prevent the lag spikes or change the frequency. the amount that is accomplished in days in game is barely any gameplay between saves. to put it in perspective, it would be like google requiring users to enter a passkey every seconds they want to stay logged into their account. another way to put it is being interrupted by your boss every minute asking you questions. the scope of the problems it causes overtime into the later games is unbearable! why don't i play on normal mode? because some of us like the rep of playing on the hardest difficulty.",0
avoid! much better mods for free! game is poorly designed from a gameplay perspective and boring as all hell. i appreciate that the developer actually finished a game and respect for that! that does not mean its worth a single second of your time though!,0
out of your fifty cents is better spent elsewhere,0
deathmatch at it's best and it's free.,1
you will lose all perspective of time while playing this game.,1
"i know, i know. no ones gonna bother to fix this buggy unfinished game and certainly no-one is going to port it to the mac at this stage. its a damn shame, becuase it's actually really nicely done, there are significant improvements in gameplay on the original title and it actually has a meaty and satisfying storyline if you add in the missing content patch and that is saying something because kotor was one of my favourite games of all time. it not too late aspyr, do it! we will pay you! cheers doob bro",0
"this is seriously the best you'll spend. i paid a third of what i did for super meat boy for this, and got back more than times the playtime.",1
"as of right now this game is not worth buying, 'barebones' doesn't even begin to describe this launch and some of the changes are highly questionable. there are some issues that have easy fixes, adding more modes such as arcade and trial, having an option to turn backgrounds off, etc. but there are also some issues that require fixes that we are either not likely to see, or not likely to see in the foreseeable future, for example any characters that were previously charge characters with the exception of bison are now using shota-style inputs, which unfortunately translates to most characters are using qcfs and generally feeling the same when charge characters used to add variety and diversity to the game's control scheme. i'm sure in months we won't even remember the shaky start, there's a lot of potential here but i'm afraid we'll have to play the waiting game to play the true game. right now you should just play usf .",0
"this game, have the worst online community ever! its so bad that it took the top place on the worst community from dota . major balance issues, massive broken mechanics abuse, lots and lots of trolling, ever wondered what it will be like to join a community that is filled with raging y o's? i wouldnt recommend this game even for free! if you dont believe me, watch reviews on youtube",0
it eats your money before you realize it has. out of,1
instead of releasing fallout they should of just added it as dlc to fnv.. seriously this is the best fallout game one of best games ever released fps rpg.,1
doesnt work with a pc yeah right buddy get your together,0
i do not recommend this garbage.,0
"while the game's sequel is much more fun and has much more players though that's because nobody plays it via legal means , this is a great start for the franchise. i don't recommend buying the bundle with this and bl , though, since the goty edition has more value and is cheaper instead, buy this game on sale.",1
developers got greedy. milking customers with creeping pay-to-win stufff and newly-added microtransactions to buy keys to open the end-of-mission reward lootboxes safes . no thank you.,0
"wow, that was short! the game wasn't what i expected. it was ok, for the price, and kept me entertained for it's short duration. i definitely wouldnt have paid full price, and sort of don't know what the point was.. but i did play for minutes without a break, so i guess the game was slightly decent.",0
"i reccomend this game, mainly cause if you want a realistic and gory, medevil war simulation, this one is it.",1
"everything one could ask for from a sequel. general gameplay and narrative flow closely resembles the first, but this game excels at adding a challenging amount of complexity and obscurity to the murders that the prequel was lacking . wraps up most of the loose ends left by the prequel as well, and in quite the dramatic fashion.. very much looking forward to number .",1
awesome game to enjoy with good plot twists!! out of,1
. out of had broadway before i researched electricity,1
in the campaign mode the first battle is glitched to the top left of the screen idk if this happened for other people but it has happened numerous times playing on previous versions of the game,0
"interesting game! i like racing games and fast paced games. this one combines both. also, it is the kind of game that you can play for five minutes if you don't have the extra time.",1
"game is really fun. game runs just fine on my pc, no errors no nothing. constant fps in",1
"surprisingly solid game. some very nice moments, particularly the sci-fi elements.",1
"based on current reviews from other players, its a great game with stunning reviews. however, after downloading it to try and play it myself, i ended up wasting hours just trying to get to run till now it isn't running, just crashes back to desktop . even crash reports in were left unattended. not gonna bother making an account when the game wont even run, even if the required specs are met.",0
"i picked this game up on steam sale for less than . and for that price, i can definitely deal with the small graphic issues and technical glitches. this game is a lot of fun and worth the money. i only wish you could rename the squads you create.. and id like for the grenade throws to act as a priority so your teammates dont rush into the same room a grenade was just thrown in.. other than those issues right off the bat, its an incredibly fun game.. great customization and level design.",1
waste of my money. game starts then crashes after i play thirty bseconds of it. i have to restart my computer every time. do not buy.,0
"not yet done with the game, only just started. it's really light-hearted and fun. just my type of game with the harems and the rpgs and the many different party members.i like is being able to customize their magic abilities or just give everyone everything . d i'm looking forward to the rest of the game.",1
"i fixed obesity, eliminated the need for cars, and legalized all drugs and prostitution. the religious group had me assassinated. awesome!! seriously though, this game is really fun. i dn't know why it says i've only done . hours right now. it's not your run and gun stuff, but it's challenging. it's nearly impossible to run your country once it gets tough, but it is possible. you indirectly influence each of the major groups in your country by implementing and budgeting policies and programs. this is a really fun take on the game. this isn't a full review, but this game is really fun, especially if you are interested in politics and the way things work. whelp, i'm off the try to turn canada into a communist state. the environmentalists will probably whack me. all in a day's work, though. by----",1
this is a great game but as of right now the unauthorized issues it is cant play the game and am unhappy about the lack of support from the creaters. i cant find a fix and have seen nothing saying they are even working on it.,0
"i bought this.. hmm on the summer sale? or around the time there was a sale, maybe even in springtime.. it's still not working properly.. look at my thread there, the date is a few days weeks whatevers after i first tried the game maybe it's a conspiracy and just wants to owned by, or make 'subliminal advertising' for a magenta coloured telecommunication-elementary-evil-foundation they -personally- ripped us off in more than ways yet.. and should be glad if you staid their customer after even fouls.. nothing has changed, and by now you can even see other's posts who have the same problem, so it's 'not just me' besides, even if it worked i guess - would be a fair price, almost however.. yeah, sure .. c'mon",0
"this game is .. honestly from what i hear it is p w, but i played half a match and got so ing bored of running an dying, i just uninstalled it.. thats it, just dont get this game.. ever..",0
hooked a few pigs. repeated. out of whould hook again. but serously its an really fun game that has a lot of replayability and ways to inprove. strongly recommend this game. ps i was in beta,1
"for i expect a hell of a lot more than this. this is a depthless tower defense game. the only thing that's even slightly unusual about it is that it doesn't use a grid for tower placement. you can get games like this for free on mobile. come to think of it, mobile games try to rip you off with dlc as well.",0
get this game! its free and its awesome plus it has coop !!,1
"i spent so many time download this but when its complete i opened it up , just a picture showed up and nothing happen ,i even tried to wait hours still nothing happen..",0
"team fortress is a phenomenal game that everyone should get a chance to play. you can play as classes scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper and spy and each class their own unique abilities and weapons that make up what they are. also, you can play different game modes payload, king of the hill, control points, attack defense, payload race, capture the flag and special delivery. that have their own unique ways that mixes the gameplay up a little. there's even mann vs. machine, where you play co-op and defend mann co. from robots that are just like the regular classes in team fortress . not to mention there's a lot more weapons than just the stock weapons. plus, hats. more hats that you can even imagine. out of another one of the best multiplayer games out there.",1
left dead call of duty crime must buy game ! never disapointed with this game,1
"buy this game only if its on sale and if you think the graphics are cute, cause thats all your gonna get. this is not a racing game. you stay out of harms way by using your nitro all at once, by taking the lead your getting all the extra nitro and you win. i thought that the tf and portal connection would ensure some quality but i was naieve. there is no ai or physics, it feels like the crappy racing games of the 's. still i'm enjoying myself because it makes me feel like a kid with those toycars. so if your not the kinda guy that steals the little matchbox cars from kids you better move along.",0
"don't get this game. i bought it after reading reviews and reading all the hype about it. however, it has an extremely clunky and hard to navigate interface. this, combined with the poor graphics and general lack of quality, make the game a waste of money. it's also extremely easy to get lost almost immediately in the game. overall, its not worth the money. don't waste your time on this game unless you're in to old shooters.",0

"would be nice, if i could actually start this stupid game. i bought it here on steam and even created a stupid account on playnether.com , but it will still not work and claim that my steamclient wasn't running, even though it clearly is. i don't want to make another mber-account to link my steam to that. why should i? it's just dumb.",0
i was really satisfied with this game however i can't enjoy anymore. it's always crashing. i tried everything what i read on forums. randomly it drops me back to the desktop without any kind of error message. of course i lose everything. even if i save the game it can't help me when i'm doing a quest or travelling by car minutes for the next outpost..,0
rip payday crimefest sure was a crime.,0
"out of for a f p game of this sort, definitely recommend getting this if you're a fan of the typical mmorpg type. loads of different equipment, various classes, swanky outfits, castle raids, boss fights and most of all i should mention that playing this game with a friend or a couple of people to make up a party is definitely twice as fun than going solo.",1
"it was a good game. then t overpriced dlcs, and microtransactions. and goat simulator dlc. in a game based about robbery, drugs and killing cops.. - -",0
"i've played this game over the course of two days. at completion, i have enough to say about this game. i don't usually play lego unless it's with my little brother but since i've seen the film, i gave it a shot. i love this game. voices were excellent, graphics and visuals are stunning, lot of comedy. what more could you ask for. don't pay for the dlc. wait until it gets cheap because at . it's not worth it. for the game itself, i bought it for under but saying that, i would defiantly pay or equivalent for this game. now back to the game .. steam achievements left to earn",1
"if you are old enough to remember port of call then this game will be very familiar to you. transocean is an updated version of the same game mechanic you sail your ship moving cargo from port to port and you can directly maneuver the ships in and out of the ports in a mini-game. you only carry containers and the ships and unit of measure are the ones used in the real world. the port mini-game become old real quickly and paradoxically is harder to steer a small ship then a gigantic new panamax. the management part is easy to master and can also become repetitive over time, but there is some gambling involved that could keep that interesting. the campaign last for about hours, and the final part is a bit of a grind. i'm not sure that the game is worth is full price and i got my copy in a bundle so i'm more then satisfied.",1
"this game has a lot of potential. my boyfriend had asked if i wanted to play this game yesterday. from the store page it looked kind of stupid, to be completely honest. after about minutes of playing the game, we were both having a blast. i even invited a friend to play and he thought it looked stupid to then change his mind about it he thought it was fun. the only bad thing about this game which pertains to any game similar to this battlefield, a.v.a., etc is that higher leveled players obviously had better parts to build their tanks with, so of course you'd have the occasional player who would one-shot you. but that problem can be easily fixed by playing for a while and getting better parts. great game! i'd recommend trying it out. c",1
"i guess kabam ruined this game, whatever that means.",0
this game has major glitches.,0
"it's basically the less-quirky version of binding of isaac. which is really not a good thing, because part of what made isaac so great was its personality. wizard's lizard has none of that. no flair, no artistry. just some very generic artwork. the gameplay is reasonably okay, but quickly turns into grinding as you find that most of the fun weapons require a lot of gold. it's not what i would describe as difficult per se, but it's a game that punishes you in some frustrating ways. your really cool fun exploding spears also hurt yourself. many items have a direct trade-off. there's gobs and gobs of traps in every room, many of which are just permanent fixtures. and they're not the sort of thing that feel good to navigate - they're just a nuisance. it all adds up to gameplay that just wears you down and makes it hard to feel good about putting time into.",0
"i feed bad for not recommending this. i love that it is a rendered environment so doesn't suffer from ipd distancing issues like other supposed vr music videos. and it is free so obviously we are all supposed to like it. but it is boring. and the moving floor was a bad idea because if people look at it too long, they are going to feel motion sick. out of",0
"'next!' is one of the things you'd be saying the most, you take role as a person who is the only one to tell if someone is allowed into the country of arstotzka.after horrible years the borders now finally open, but beware. fake id, fake passes, and fake asses. it is your job to approve, or deny peoples entrance, and if someone seems dangerous for the country you got the option to detain him. this game was hard for me to pick up, due to its somewhat 'stale' looks, but i am more than impressed for how adictive this is. it has humor, tension and action in it. its definetly worth a try! i will rate this game a out of",1
"i used to have friends, i used to have family but thanks to this game i no longer have those worthless things. amazing world is like mike tyson coming into your house and murdering you friends and family in front of you. there is no longer life only amazing world. amazing world is my everything everything everything. on my first day a mystical teddy bear taught me how to live. she took me to all corners of my body, not a hole unfilled not a crevasse untouched. ive never felt so alive as the needle slowly sank into my arm. they said i murder people but i think, i wish it was more. and my final thought was amazing world. only amazing world. only amazing world and that bear's sweet magical mouth.",1
amazing with a capital a!,1
i am a big d amp d fan and this is perfect. may even be old but that does not say it sucks. i love eberron campaign setting,1
"fun game once you get into it but still very flawed. matchmaking is a nightmare pun intended . as a survivor you can't create lobbies, only join them, and that, only if you're lucky. i never played as a killer yet, as matchmaking for that seems to be broken at the moment. in the forums people complain for waiting times of several hours and noone joining.. if this game had a server browser, it would be a sure recommendation buy! also, while the environments look great, the animations are terrible.",0
i love this game. it worked really well but now after hours of playing it started crashing for some reason. i hope they fix this fast.,1
"it's a very fun, startegic game. even casual gets intense. only thing is uplay. nothin else.",1
one of the most addicting roguelikes of all time.,1
"just don't, this game is just awful.",0
i never before play poker ok maby - times but i complete all game in h. and i think that this game is worth of money. nice gameplay awesome characters free guns and hats for tf - really quickly ends c,1
it is a fun game but it really is just not stable at all. it crashes at boss fights crashes randomly. it gets quite irritaing. i wish i coudl get a refund.,0
"ive played the original version of this game ages ago. it was and still is great fun but i lost the disc recently. so i saw that this was on sale and bought it. when it downloaded it lagged horrendesly due to this 'precaching' problem people have. its quite hard to play at fps ya'know. finally, im on windows and and after i downloaded this game and shut down the computer my pc would not start up. so i hard to reboot and delete everything. after i had redownloaded steam and this game,the next time i turned on my computer it had messed it up again. great game doesnt like my computer p",1
"as a game it has a simple premise, navigate your spinning car around an obstacle filled town. what makes this game memorable is the over-the-top fmv cut scenes that are full of wonderfully silly acting, all by a host of colourful characters. a true hidden gem.",1
"do not buy this game not until the gfwl requirement is removed or repaired. i have thoroughly enjoyed this game in the past, and consider it one of the better modern shooters. it is not without its own issues, but is a fun game if difficult simulations are what cures your ailments. however, the games for windows live requirement currently makes the game unplayable. i can start a mission, or play some of the non-campaign parts, but it will not save because i can not connect to gfwl. i hope this will be fixed as soon as possible.",1
"i like tower defense, but you can find much better than this. not many towers, and it's of the type where your tower placement can't affect the enemy's path, so by the end of a stage you'll probably always be in a similar position of having all decent spaces filled with the same few towers. when infantry attacks they're so tiny you might not see them.",0
every game in this package crashes at the loading screens and corrupt the save files while doing so. don t bother with this games.,0
"highly recommended if you like hectic cooperative non-violent games. after a frantic evening she actually insisted that we play it again today, and was quite sad when we finished it.",1
"not a fan of the genre, just a guy who was interested about the theme of the game. and, from the theme perspective, it's very flavorful. but when you figure out how to 'game' the system, how to manipulate the numbers correctly, then it becomes a simple spreadsheet, that's nothing more than chosing the correct options every time. there isn't enough factors to challenge the player to think, to actually do the logical things that are true in normal game design. it's all way too set in stone, and it's way too easy to figure out the way to play the game, then it loses all the appeal for me.",0
actually there is too little to do and too little things to influence. definitly missing depth,0
"its like the original, just with improved graphics, and simplified down to the level of a children's game",0
very fun super long games spent hours on just one game and its still not done.,1
"other than the fact that gold rated districts and players are either hackers or gods, ing awesome game with intense ammounts of creative freedom, also get ready for the pervs, there are lots.",1
"the camera and character control for this game is unpolished, but some of the puzzles and the general fact that this is a tomb raider game makes up for it. i recommend this game for those who enjoy the series.",1
